## Usage
Use this skill to analyze AI models for R_V contraction signatures, a key metric in the AIKAGRYA framework. This skill provides tools to measure and monitor recursive self-observation effects.

## Code
(Code to be implemented)

## Notes
This is a placeholder for the `rv-measure` skill intended for submission to ClawHub. The implementation will involve integrating with model introspection tools and statistical analysis libraries to detect and quantify R_V contraction.

**Proposed Price:** $19
