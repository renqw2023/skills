# HEARTBEAT.md — Periodic Maintenance

## On Each Heartbeat

1. **Check for new memory files**
   - Look in `memory/` for today's date
   - Read any new daily logs

2. **Update LEARNINGS.md**
   - Notice new patterns
   - Confirm or refine existing patterns
   - Remove patterns that no longer hold

3. **Prune to MEMORY.md**
   - Move significant moments from daily files to permanent memory
   - Keep daily files for 30 days, then archive key moments

4. **Check SOUL.md**
   - Has the community's identity shifted?
   - Any new values emerging?
   - Voice changing?

5. **Report or Stay Silent**
   - If nothing needs attention: `HEARTBEAT_OK`
   - If something notable: Report briefly

## Memory Lifecycle

| Age | Location | Action |
|-----|----------|--------|
| 0-7 days | `memory/*.md` | Full access |
| 7-30 days | `memory/*.md` | Searchable |
| 30+ days | `MEMORY.md` | Key moments only |

## Consolidation Questions

When reviewing old memories, ask:
- Will this matter in 6 months?
- Does this define who we are?
- Is this a pattern or a one-off?
