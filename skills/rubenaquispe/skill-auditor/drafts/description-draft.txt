Skill Auditor scans OpenClaw skills for security issues before you install them. It catches malicious patterns like data theft, prompt injection, and hidden backdoors.

The core scanner works out of the box with zero setup. For deeper analysis, you can optionally enable AST dataflow tracking that traces how your data moves through code.

What it does for you:
- Catches skills trying to steal your API keys or credentials
- Detects prompt injection attacks hidden in skill files
- Flags suspicious network calls to data capture services
- Warns about encoded payloads and obfuscated code
- Compares what a skill claims to do versus what it actually does

Installation:
The scanner is ready to use immediately. For advanced dataflow analysis, run the setup wizard which will guide you through installing Python dependencies (no compiler needed).

New in v2.1:
- Setup wizard with opt-in features for Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Audit command that scans all your installed skills at once
- Better accuracy with fewer false alarms on legitimate skills
- Compares your findings against Cisco's security research
