# DEPRECATED

This skill has been superseded by **x-actionbook-recap** (generic: any handle + optional keyword search).

Install the new one:

```bash
clawhub install x-actionbook-recap
```

If you previously installed this skill, migrate by uninstalling/removing the old folder and installing the new slug.
