## A) Single-post recap (no thread)

**Option 1 (themes + caveat)**

> Quick look at @elonmusk’s posting themes over the last {N} days: {theme1}; {theme2}; {theme3}. Observations from public posts only; interpretations may vary.

**Option 2 (one focal idea)**

> Theme: {theme}. Representative: {link or paraphrase}.

3) Theme 2 (politics/news amplification)
> Theme: {theme}. Mostly via {reposts/quotes}. Representative: {link}.

4) Theme 3 (space/long-term planning)
> Theme: {theme}. Representative: {link}.

5) One thread worth reading
> If you read one: {thread link}. Key claim: “{short quote if captured verbatim}”.

6) Interpretation (clearly labeled)
> My read: {interpretation}. (Speculation; reasonable people may disagree.)

7) What’s missing / uncertainty
