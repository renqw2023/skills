# Brownfield Onboarder - Intelligent CLAUDE.md Merger

**Purpose**: Intelligently merge existing CLAUDE.md backups into SpecWeave's structure without bloating the main CLAUDE.md file.

**When to Use**: After installing SpecWeave into an existing project that had CLAUDE.md

**Philosophy**: Keep CLAUDE.md as a concise guide, distribute detailed content to appropriate SpecWeave folders.

**Modes**: Supports both Quick Start (incremental) and Comprehensive (upfront) approaches 🆕

---

## Two-Mode Support 🆕

The brownfield-onboarder works differently based on the chosen documentation path:

### Quick Start Mode (Incremental)
**Philosophy**: Merge only essential context, defer detailed docs to per-increment

**What to merge immediately**:
- ✅ Core architecture overview (high-level)
- ✅ Tech stack and infrastructure
- ✅ Critical patterns (auth, payment, security)
- ✅ Team conventions and workflows
- ✅ Project summary and domain context

**What to defer** (document per increment):
- ⏸️ Detailed business rules (extract when modifying that code)
- ⏸️ Module-specific documentation (extract when working on that module)
- ⏸️ API-level documentation (extract when touching those APIs)
- ⏸️ Code examples (extract as needed)

**Result**: Minimal upfront merge (30-60 minutes), detailed docs grow incrementally

### Comprehensive Mode (Upfront)
**Philosophy**: Merge everything upfront for complete context

**What to merge**:
- ✅ All architecture documentation
- ✅ All business rules
- ✅ All module-specific docs
- ✅ All API documentation
- ✅ All conventions and patterns
- ✅ All code examples

**Result**: Complete merge (1-3 hours), full context available immediately

### Mode Selection

**Auto-detection**:
```typescript
// Settings auto-detected
const mode = config.brownfield?.mode || 'auto';

if (mode === 'auto') {
  // Use complexity from brownfield-analyzer
  const complexity = await readComplexityAssessment();
  mode = complexity.recommendedPath === 'Quick Start' ? 'incremental' : 'comprehensive';
}
```

**User can override**:
```bash
# Force Quick Start mode
brownfield-onboarder --mode quick-start

# Force Comprehensive mode
brownfield-onboarder --mode comprehensive
```

---

## The Problem

When installing SpecWeave into an existing project:
1. Project already has `CLAUDE.md` with valuable project-specific context
2. SpecWeave installs its own `CLAUDE.md` as the development guide
3. Old `CLAUDE.md` is backed up to `.claude/backups/CLAUDE-backup-{timestamp}.md`
4. Need to intelligently merge project-specific content WITHOUT bloating SpecWeave's CLAUDE.md

---

## The Solution: Smart Distribution

**Instead of bloating CLAUDE.md**, distribute content to appropriate folders:

```
Project-specific content → SpecWeave folders:

# Internal Documentation (strategic, team-only)
Architecture details    → .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/existing-system.md
Technology stack        → .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/tech-stack.md
Business rules          → .specweave/docs/internal/strategy/business-rules.md
Team workflows          → .specweave/docs/internal/processes/team-workflows.md
Deployment process      → .specweave/docs/internal/processes/deployment.md
Domain knowledge        → .specweave/increments/{####-name}/docs/domain/{domain}.md

# Public Documentation (user-facing, can be published)
Project conventions     → .specweave/docs/public/guides/project-conventions.md
API conventions         → .specweave/docs/public/guides/api-conventions.md
Code style              → .specweave/docs/public/guides/code-style.md
```

**Only add to CLAUDE.md**: High-level project summary (1-2 paragraphs max)

---

## Activation

**Trigger**: User runs `specweave merge-docs` or asks "merge my old CLAUDE.md"

**Auto-detection**:
1. Check if `.claude/backups/CLAUDE-backup-*.md` exists
2. If multiple backups, use most recent
3. If no backups, inform user and exit gracefully

---

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Parse Backup CLAUDE.md

**Extract sections**:
```typescript
interface ParsedCLAUDEmd {
  projectName: string;
  projectDescription: string;
  techStack: TechStack;
  architecture: ArchitectureSection[];
  conventions: Convention[];
  workflows: Workflow[];
  domainKnowledge: DomainSection[];
  teamGuidelines: TeamGuideline[];
  deploymentProcess: DeploymentSection[];
  apiDesign: APISection[];
  businessRules: BusinessRule[];
  codeExamples: CodeExample[];
  customInstructions: Instruction[];
}
```

**Section Detection Keywords**:
- **Tech Stack**: "technology", "framework", "database", "infrastructure", "stack", "tools"
- **Architecture**: "architecture", "system design", "components", "services", "microservices"
- **Conventions**: "naming convention", "code style", "pattern", "standard", "guideline"
- **Workflows**: "workflow", "process", "pipeline", "deployment flow", "release process"
- **Domain**: Domain-specific terms (e.g., "patient", "booking", "payment", "order")
- **Business Rules**: "business rule", "validation", "policy", "constraint", "requirement"
- **API Design**: "API", "endpoint", "REST", "GraphQL", "authentication", "authorization"
- **Deployment**: "deploy", "CI/CD", "environment", "production", "staging"

### Step 2: Classify Content (Mode-Aware) 🆕

**For each section, determine**:

1. **Generic or Project-Specific?**
   - Generic: Common programming advice, general best practices
   - Project-specific: Domain knowledge, team conventions, project architecture

2. **Overlap with SpecWeave CLAUDE.md?**
   - Compare section with SpecWeave's CLAUDE.md
   - If >80% similar, skip (already covered)
   - If <80% similar, extract unique content

3. **Essential or Detailed?** 🆕
   - Essential: Core architecture, critical patterns, tech stack, team workflows
   - Detailed: Module-specific rules, detailed APIs, code examples

4. **Mode-Based Decision** 🆕
   - **Quick Start Mode**: Merge essential only, defer detailed
   - **Comprehensive Mode**: Merge everything

5. **Target Destination**
   - Determine best SpecWeave folder for this content
   - See "Content Distribution Rules" below

**Classification Matrix** 🆕:

| Content Type | Essential? | Quick Start Action | Comprehensive Action |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Core Architecture | ✅ Yes | Merge immediately | Merge immediately |
| Tech Stack | ✅ Yes | Merge immediately | Merge immediately |
| Critical Patterns (auth, payment) | ✅ Yes | Merge immediately | Merge immediately |
| Team Conventions | ✅ Yes | Merge immediately | Merge immediately |
| Project Summary | ✅ Yes | Merge immediately | Merge immediately |
| Detailed Business Rules | ❌ No | **Defer to increment** | Merge immediately |
| Module Documentation | ❌ No | **Defer to increment** | Merge immediately |
| API-Level Docs | ❌ No | **Defer to increment** | Merge immediately |
| Code Examples | ❌ No | **Defer to increment** | Merge immediately |

**Example (Quick Start)**:
```
Analyzing CLAUDE.md backup (Quick Start mode)...

Found sections:
  ✅ Core Architecture (merge now)
  ✅ Tech Stack (merge now)
  ✅ Auth Pattern (merge now - critical)
  ⏸️ Payment Business Rules (defer - extract when working on payments)
  ⏸️ User Module API (defer - extract when modifying user code)
  ⏸️ Code Examples (defer - extract as needed)

Merging 3 sections immediately, deferring 3 for incremental extraction.
```

### Step 3: Content Distribution Rules

#### Rule 1: Domain Knowledge → Specifications

**Indicators**: Business concepts, entities, domain terminology

**Example**:
```markdown
# Old CLAUDE.md
## Domain Model

Our platform manages **patient appointments** with **healthcare providers**.
Key entities:
- Patient (demographics, insurance, medical history)
- Provider (specialties, availability, credentials)
- Appointment (time slot, status, notes)
- Clinic (location, services, staff)

Business rules:
- Appointments must be 15-60 minutes
- Patients can cancel up to 24 hours before
- Providers can override cancellation policy
```

**Destination**: `specifications/modules/appointments/domain-model.md`

**CLAUDE.md addition**: None (link from CLAUDE.md to specifications)

---

#### Rule 2: Architecture → .specweave/docs/architecture/

**Indicators**: System design, component descriptions, data flow

**Example**:
```markdown
# Old CLAUDE.md
## System Architecture

We use a microservices architecture:
- API Gateway (Kong) - routing, authentication
- Booking Service (Node.js) - appointment management
- Notification Service (Python) - email/SMS
- Payment Service (Node.js) - Stripe integration
- Database (PostgreSQL) - shared across services
```

**Destination**: `.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/existing-system.md`

**CLAUDE.md addition**:
```markdown
## Project-Specific Architecture

See [Existing System Architecture](.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/existing-system.md) for complete microservices architecture.
```

---

#### Rule 3: Conventions → .specweave/docs/guides/

**Indicators**: Naming conventions, code style, patterns

**Example**:
```markdown
# Old CLAUDE.md
## Naming Conventions

- API endpoints: `/api/v1/{resource}/{action}` (kebab-case)
- Database tables: `{domain}_{entity}` (snake_case)
- TypeScript interfaces: `I{Name}` prefix (PascalCase)
- React components: `{Name}Component.tsx` suffix
```

**Destination**: `.specweave/docs/public/guides/project-conventions.md`

**CLAUDE.md addition**: None (standard conventions, no need to clutter CLAUDE.md)

---

#### Rule 4: Workflows → .specweave/docs/guides/

**Indicators**: Deployment process, CI/CD, release workflow

**Example**:
```markdown
# Old CLAUDE.md
## Deployment Process

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Create PR (requires 2 approvals)
4. Merge → auto-deploy to staging
5. Manual approval → deploy to production
6. Rollback via GitHub Actions if needed
```

**Destination**: `.specweave/docs/internal/processes/deployment.md`

**CLAUDE.md addition**:
```markdown
## Deployment

See [Deployment Guide](.specweave/docs/internal/processes/deployment.md).
```

---

#### Rule 5: Business Rules → specifications/modules/

**Indicators**: Validation rules, policies, constraints

**Example**:
```markdown
# Old CLAUDE.md
## Business Rules

### Appointment Booking
- Patients can book up to 3 months in advance
- Maximum 5 active appointments per patient
- Same-day appointments require $50 deposit
- Insurance verification required before booking
```

**Destination**: `.specweave/docs/internal/strategy/appointments/business-rules.md`

**CLAUDE.md addition**: None (specifications are source of truth)

---

#### Rule 6: Tech Stack → .specweave/docs/architecture/

**Indicators**: Technologies, frameworks, tools

**Example**:
```markdown
# Old CLAUDE.md
## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js 20, Express, TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL 16, Prisma ORM
- Cache: Redis
- Queue: BullMQ
- Infrastructure: Hetzner Cloud, Terraform
- Monitoring: Grafana, Prometheus
```

**Destination**: `.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/tech-stack.md`

**CLAUDE.md addition**:
```markdown
## Tech Stack

Next.js 14 + Node.js 20 + PostgreSQL 16 + Hetzner Cloud

See [Tech Stack Details](.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/tech-stack.md).
```

---

#### Rule 7: API Design → .specweave/docs/guides/

**Indicators**: API conventions, authentication, error handling

**Example**:
```markdown
# Old CLAUDE.md
## API Design

All APIs follow REST conventions:
- Authentication: JWT in Authorization header
- Errors: Standard structure { error, message, details }
- Pagination: page, limit query params
- Filtering: field[operator]=value
- Versioning: /api/v1, /api/v2
```

**Destination**: `.specweave/docs/public/guides/api-conventions.md`

**CLAUDE.md addition**: None (guide covers it)

---

#### Rule 8: Code Examples → Discard or Minimal

**Indicators**: Code snippets, example implementations

**Decision**:
- If generic (standard pattern): Discard (SpecWeave CLAUDE.md already has examples)
- If project-specific (custom pattern): Extract to guide

**Example**:
```markdown
# Old CLAUDE.md - Generic React pattern
function UserList() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
  // ... standard React code
}
```

**Action**: Discard (generic React, not project-specific)

**Example**:
```markdown
# Old CLAUDE.md - Custom authentication pattern
// Our custom auth hook (wraps Supabase)
function useCustomAuth() {
  const { session } = useSupabase();
  const { roles } = useRoleProvider();
  return { user: session?.user, hasRole: (role) => roles.includes(role) };
}
```

**Action**: Extract to `.specweave/docs/public/guides/authentication.md` (project-specific pattern)

---

### Step 4: Update CLAUDE.md (Minimal)

**ONLY add high-level project summary** to SpecWeave's CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
---

## Project-Specific Context

**Project**: Healthcare Appointment Booking Platform
**Domain**: Healthcare, Patient Management, Provider Scheduling

### Quick Links
- [Domain Model](.specweave/increments/####-name/docs/domain/appointments/domain-model.md)
- [Existing System Architecture](.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/existing-system.md)
- [Tech Stack](.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/tech-stack.md)
- [Business Rules](.specweave/docs/internal/strategy/appointments/business-rules.md)
- [Deployment Guide](.specweave/docs/internal/processes/deployment.md)
- [Project Conventions](.specweave/docs/public/guides/project-conventions.md)

**Note**: All project-specific details are in linked documents. This keeps CLAUDE.md concise.

---
```

**Total addition**: ~15 lines max

---

## Intelligence Rules

### Avoid Bloat

**Never add to CLAUDE.md**:
- Generic programming advice (SpecWeave CLAUDE.md already has it)
- Detailed code examples (put in guides)
- Long architecture descriptions (put in architecture docs)
- Business rule details (put in specifications)
- API documentation (put in guides)

**Only add to CLAUDE.md**:
- 1-2 sentence project description
- Domain/industry context
- Links to detailed docs

### Avoid Duplicates

**Before creating files, check if similar content exists**:

```typescript
// Check if domain model already exists
if (exists("specifications/modules/appointments/domain-model.md")) {
  // Compare content
  existingContent = read("specifications/modules/appointments/domain-model.md");
  newContent = extractDomainModel(backupCLAUDEmd);

  if (similarity(existingContent, newContent) > 0.8) {
    // Skip, already documented
    skip();
  } else {
    // Merge unique content
    mergedContent = merge(existingContent, newContent);
    write("specifications/modules/appointments/domain-model.md", mergedContent);
  }
}
```

### Preserve Accuracy

**When extracting content**:
- Don't paraphrase technical details
- Preserve exact terminology
- Keep code examples verbatim
- Maintain formatting (tables, lists, code blocks)

### User Confirmation

**Before writing files, show user**:

```
I found the following project-specific content in your backup CLAUDE.md:

📦 Domain Model (Healthcare Appointments)
   → .specweave/increments/####-name/docs/domain/appointments/domain-model.md

## Deferred Content (Extract Per Increment)

The following content remains in the backup and will be extracted when you work on related features:

### 📦 Domain Documentation
- `appointments/domain-model.md` (450 lines)
  → Extract when creating increment for appointments feature

### 📋 Business Rules
- `payments/business-rules.md` (280 lines)
  → Extract when creating increment for payment modifications

### 🔌 API Documentation
- `users/api-endpoints.md` (150 lines)
  → Extract when creating increment for user service changes

### 💻 Code Examples
- Various code snippets (200 lines)
  → Extract as needed

**How to extract later**:
```bash
# When starting increment for appointments
/inc "Refactor appointment booking"

# In spec.md, reference:
# "See backup: .claude/backups/CLAUDE-backup-*.md (appointments section)"

# Or ask:
# "Extract appointment documentation from CLAUDE.md backup"
```
