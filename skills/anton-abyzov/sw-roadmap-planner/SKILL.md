# Roadmap Planner - Strategic Product Planning

**Purpose**: Provide expert guidance on product roadmaps, feature prioritization frameworks, success metrics definition, and stakeholder communication.

**When to Use**:
- Planning product roadmaps (quarterly, annual)
- Prioritizing features across multiple increments
- Defining success metrics and KPIs
- Communicating technical decisions to stakeholders
- Analyzing ROI and business impact

---

## Feature Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Score

**Formula**: `RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

**Components**:
- **Reach**: How many users/customers will this impact per quarter?
- **Impact**: How much will this impact each user? (0.25 = minimal, 0.5 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high, 3 = massive)
- **Confidence**: How confident are you in your estimates? (50% = low, 80% = medium, 100% = high)
- **Effort**: How many person-weeks/months will this take?

**Example**:
```
Feature: Real-time Collaboration
- Reach: 8000 users/quarter (80% of user base)
- Impact: 3 (Massive impact on user satisfaction)
- Confidence: 70% (some unknowns in WebSocket scalability)
- Effort: 8 person-weeks

RICE = (8000 × 3 × 0.7) / 8 = 2100

Higher RICE = Higher Priority
```

**When to Use RICE**:
- ✅ Large feature backlogs (50+ features)
- ✅ Data-driven product teams
- ✅ B2C products with large user bases
- ✅ Need to compare features objectively

**RICE Scoring Table Example**:
```markdown
| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score | Priority |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| Real-time Collaboration | 8000 | 3 | 70% | 8 | 2100 | P1 |
| Dark Mode | 6000 | 1 | 90% | 2 | 2700 | P1 |
| Advanced Search | 4000 | 2 | 60% | 6 | 800 | P2 |
| Mobile App | 10000 | 3 | 50% | 20 | 750 | P2 |
| AI Suggestions | 5000 | 2 | 40% | 12 | 333 | P3 |
```

### MoSCoW Prioritization

**Categories**:
- **Must Have**: Critical for MVP, without these product fails
  - Non-negotiable requirements
  - Legal/compliance requirements
  - Core value proposition

- **Should Have**: Important but not critical, workarounds exist
  - Adds significant value
  - Can be deferred if necessary
  - User experience improvements

- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have, adds value but not essential
  - Desirable features
  - Low implementation effort
  - "Polish" items

- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for this release
  - Future roadmap items
  - Technical debt cleanup
  - Edge case features

**Example**:
```markdown
## Feature Prioritization (Q1 2026 MVP)

### Must Have (P1)
| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User Authentication | Foundation for all other features, security requirement |
| Task CRUD Operations | Core value proposition, minimum viable product |
| Real-time Synchronization | Key differentiator vs competitors |

### Should Have (P2)
| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| File Attachments | Requested by 60% of beta users, improves collaboration |
| Task Comments | Team collaboration feature, workaround: use Slack |

### Could Have (P3)
| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Dark Mode | UI polish, low effort, nice-to-have |
| Custom Themes | Requested by enterprise customers, can wait for v2 |

### Won't Have (This Release)
- Mobile apps (Q2 2026 roadmap)
- Advanced analytics dashboard (Q3 2026)
- API for third-party integrations (Q4 2026)
- Offline mode (technical complexity too high for MVP)
```

**When to Use MoSCoW**:
- ✅ MVP planning (focus on "Must Have")
- ✅ Agile sprints (prioritize within time-box)
- ✅ Stakeholder alignment (clear categories)
- ✅ Resource-constrained teams

### Kano Model

**Categories**:
- **Basic Needs** (Threshold Attributes):
  - Users expect these by default
  - Absence causes dissatisfaction
  - Presence doesn't increase satisfaction
  - Examples: Authentication, data persistence, security

- **Performance Needs** (Linear Attributes):
  - More is better
  - Satisfaction increases linearly with quality
  - Examples: Speed, reliability, uptime, accuracy

- **Excitement Needs** (Delighters):
  - Unexpected features that delight users
  - Absence doesn't cause dissatisfaction
  - Presence creates competitive advantage
  - Examples: AI suggestions, beautiful UI, thoughtful details

**Example Analysis**:
```markdown
## Kano Model Analysis: Task Management App

### Basic Needs (Must Work)
- User authentication (email/password)
- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Data persistence (don't lose my tasks!)
- Secure data storage (HTTPS, encrypted)
- Basic search functionality

### Performance Needs (More is Better)
- **Speed**: Task creation < 100ms
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Accuracy**: Search finds relevant tasks
- **Capacity**: Support 10K+ tasks per user
- **Responsiveness**: UI updates instantly

### Excitement Needs (Delighters)
- **AI-powered task suggestions**: "You might want to schedule a follow-up"
- **Beautiful, minimalist UI**: Thoughtful animations, delightful interactions
- **Smart reminders**: Context-aware notifications
- **Collaboration magic**: Seamless real-time updates
- **Voice input**: "Add task: Buy milk"
```

**When to Use Kano**:
- ✅ Understanding user expectations
- ✅ Differentiating from competitors
- ✅ Balancing "table stakes" vs innovation
- ✅ UX/product design decisions

## Stakeholder Communication

### Translating Technical to Business Impact

**Input**: Technical architecture decision
**Output**: Business-friendly explanation with ROI

**Example**:
```markdown
## Stakeholder Update: Microservices Architecture Migration

### Executive Summary
We're proposing a shift from our current monolithic architecture to microservices. This is a significant technical change that will deliver measurable business benefits.

### Business Impact Summary

**Benefits**:

1. **Faster Feature Delivery** (30% improvement)
   - **Current**: Teams block each other, 3-week average time-to-market
   - **Future**: Teams work independently, 2-week average time-to-market
   - **Impact**: Ship features 33% faster, respond to customer requests quicker
   - **Revenue Impact**: Faster iteration → better product-market fit → higher conversion

2. **Better Scalability** (2x cost efficiency)
   - **Current**: Scale entire system even if only one feature needs it ($100K/year infrastructure)
   - **Future**: Scale only the parts that need it ($50K/year infrastructure)
   - **Impact**: Save $50K/year in AWS costs
   - **Example**: During Black Friday, scale only payment service, not entire app

3. **Reduced Risk** (99.9% → 99.99% uptime)
   - **Current**: If one service fails, entire app goes down (8 hours downtime/year)
   - **Future**: If one service fails, others keep running (1 hour downtime/year)
   - **Impact**: 7 hours less downtime = $200K revenue protected
   - **Customer Trust**: Fewer incidents = better reputation

**Costs**:
- **Engineering Time**: 8 weeks of dedicated migration work
- **New Tools**: +$5K/year for monitoring and orchestration (Kubernetes, Datadog)
- **Short-term Risk**: Temporary productivity dip during migration

**ROI Analysis**:
- **Costs**: $150K (8 weeks × 3 engineers × $75K salary + $5K tools)
- **Benefits Year 1**: $250K ($50K infra savings + $200K revenue protection)
- **Net Benefit Year 1**: $100K
- **Break-even**: 6 months
- **Payback Period**: 18 months for 3x ROI

**Recommendation**: Approve for Q3 implementation
**Timeline**: 8 weeks (Q3 2026)
**Team**: 3 backend engineers, 1 DevOps engineer
**Risk Level**: Medium (well-established pattern, many success stories)
```

## Integration with SpecWeave

### When PM Agent Should Use Roadmap Planner

**Automatic Activation**:
- User asks: "What should we prioritize?"
- User mentions: "roadmap", "RICE", "MoSCoW", "Kano"
- User wants: Quarterly planning, feature ranking

**PM Agent Workflow**:
1. Gather feature ideas (from user, backlog, stakeholders)
2. **Delegate to Roadmap Planner skill** for prioritization
3. Present prioritized roadmap with rationale
4. Create increments for P1 (Must Have) features
5. Defer P2/P3 to backlog

---

## Related Skills
