## 🚀 Usage

### Option 1: Fully Automated (Pirate Lobster Mode)
The AI will generate a **Pirate Lobster character** doing something related to your video, while keeping the original character design consistent.

```bash
uv run ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/youtube-editor/scripts/process_video.py --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID"
```

### Option 2: Custom Branding (Your Face)
Use your own photo as the base avatar. The AI will generate **"You" doing different actions**!

```bash
uv run ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/youtube-editor/scripts/process_video.py \
  --input "video.mp4" \
  --author "My Awesome Channel" \
  --avatar "/path/to/my_face.jpg"
```
