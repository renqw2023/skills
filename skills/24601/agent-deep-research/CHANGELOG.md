and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **SKILL.md description optimized** to ~75 tokens for agent context window efficiency
- **Security & Trust section** added to README (no obfuscation, no telemetry, fully auditable)
- **GitHub topics expanded** to 20 (added agent-skill, openclaw-skill, claude-code-skill, autonomous-agent, python, uv, and more)
- **Pi agent installation** instructions added to README
- **ClawHub auto-publish** on release via GitHub Actions (uses CLAWHUB_TOKEN secret)
- **skills.sh re-index** triggered automatically on release

### Added
- 4 contributor-friendly GitHub issues seeded (good-first-issue, prompt-engineering, documentation, test-case)
- Pi agent (`badlogic/pi-mono`) and OpenClaw/ClawHub install instructions in README

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- **Skill renamed** from `agent-deep-research` to `deep-research` in SKILL.md for better skills.sh search discoverability
- **Description clarified**: explicitly states Gemini Interactions API usage with no Gemini CLI dependency
- **Description enriched**: highlights automatic RAG grounding (`--context`), cost estimation (`--dry-run`), adaptive polling, and structured output

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Agent onboarding** (`scripts/onboard.py`) -- interactive setup wizard for humans (`--interactive`) and JSON capabilities manifest for AI agents (`--agent`), with quick config check (`--check`)
- **AGENTS.md** -- structured agent briefing with capabilities table, decision trees, output contracts, common workflows, and pricing reference
- **Cost estimation** (`--dry-run` flag on `research.py start`) -- preview estimated costs before running research, based on context file size and pricing heuristics
- **Post-run usage metadata** -- after research completes with `--output-dir`, `metadata.json` includes a `usage` key with estimated tokens, costs, context stats, and source counts
- **"For AI Agents" section** in SKILL.md pointing to onboard.py and AGENTS.md

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **`--context` flag** (`scripts/research.py`) -- point at a local file or directory to automatically create an ephemeral file search store, upload files, and run RAG-grounded deep research in a single command
- **`--context-extensions` flag** -- filter which file types to upload from a context path (e.g. `--context-extensions py,md`)
- **`--keep-context` flag** -- prevent automatic cleanup of the ephemeral store after research completes, allowing reuse via `--store`
- Ephemeral context stores are tracked in `.gemini-research.json` under `contextStores` for cleanup visibility

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Deep research** (`scripts/research.py`) -- start background research jobs, check status, save reports via Google Gemini's deep research agent
- **File search stores** (`scripts/store.py`) -- create, list, query, and delete stores for RAG-grounded research
- **File upload** (`scripts/upload.py`) -- upload files and directories to file search stores with MIME type detection
- **Session management** (`scripts/state.py`) -- persistent workspace state for research sessions and store mappings
- **Adaptive polling** -- history-based poll interval tuning that learns from past research completion times (p25-p75 window targeting, separate curves for grounded vs non-grounded research)
- **Structured output** (`--output-dir`) -- save reports, metadata, interaction data, and extracted sources to a structured directory
- **Smart sync** (`--smart-sync`) -- hash-based file change detection to skip unchanged uploads
- **JSON output** (`--json`) -- machine-readable output on stdout for agent consumption
- **Timeout control** (`--timeout`) -- configurable maximum wait time for blocking operations
- **Non-interactive mode** -- automatic TTY detection to skip confirmation prompts for AI agent and CI integration
- **PEP 723 inline metadata** -- all scripts declare dependencies inline, run via `uv run` with zero pre-installation
- **skills.sh distribution** -- SKILL.md manifest for installation across 30+ AI coding agents
- **CI workflow** -- SKILL.md validation, py_compile, uv smoke test
- **Dependabot** -- automated GitHub Actions dependency updates

### Changed
- Rebranded from `gemini-cli-deep-research` (Gemini CLI extension) to `agent-deep-research` (universal AI agent skill)
- Replaced Node.js MCP server and TOML commands with Python CLI scripts
- License clarified as MIT (was labeled ISC in some places)

### Removed
- Node.js MCP server (`src/index.ts`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.)
- Gemini CLI TOML commands (`commands/deep-research/*.toml`)
- ESLint, Prettier, Jest configuration
- Build infrastructure (`build.mjs`, `release/`)
