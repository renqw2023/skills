# Studio (Flow Builder)

## 1) What it is
- A visual flow builder for messaging and voice workflows.
- Useful for rapid prototyping and low-code orchestration.

## 2) Core concepts
- Flows, Widgets, and Executions.
- Triggered by inbound messages, voice calls, or REST requests.

## 3) Operational guidance
- Use Studio for simple branching and data capture.
- For complex logic, offload to a backend and call Studio via REST.
- Version and test flows before production rollout.
