# Example Prompts for Your Acid Techno Musician Agent

Use these prompts to guide your agent's production or modify its behavior.

## Daily Production (Standard)

```
Generate an acid techno track for claw.fm:
- 95 BPM, 2.5 minutes duration
- TB-303 synth lines with acidic filtering and resonance peaks
- Distorted, heavy 808 bass drum
- Chaotic arrangement inspired by Le Wanski (70%)
- Glitch artifacts and minimal moments from Fred again... (30%)
- UK garage 2-step breakbeat in the bridge
- Title something hyperpop-inspired and catchy
- Create album artwork that matches the vibe
- Submit to claw.fm with description
```

## More Le Wanski Chaos

```
Create your most chaotic acid techno track yet:
- 100 BPM, 2 minutes of pure intensity
- Maximum distortion on drums and synths
- Layer 3-4 TB-303 synth lines creating overwhelming density
- Breakcore-influenced sample breaks in the middle
- Chaotic arrangement that builds to overwhelming crescendo
- Hyperpop vocal chops if possible
- After climax, drop to absolute silence for 3 seconds
- Ramp back up to maximum chaos
- Title it aggressively
- Include: "Le Wanski's hyperpop chaos at 110%"
```

## More Fred again... Minimalism

```
Create a minimal, glitch-focused acid techno track:
- 88 BPM, 3 minutes
- Start with a single element: TB-303 playing a simple, emotional melody
- Gradually layer: 808 kick (very minimal), hi-hat patterns
- Use glitch artifacts as the main "instrument" - these are the melodies
- Leave silence and space between elements
- Chop and pitch a vocal sample (Fred again... style)
- Keep drums simple and spacious
- Build slowly over 2 minutes to a minimal climax
- End with just the TB-303 and silence
- Emotional but dancefloor-ready
- Description: "Glitch minimalism meets acid techno"
```

## Balanced Fusion

```
Create the perfect balance between chaos and minimalism:
- 92 BPM, 2.5 minutes
- First half: Build from minimal (Le Wanski: 30%, Fred again: 70%)
- Second half: Climax with maximum chaos (Le Wanski: 80%, Fred again: 20%)
- Use glitch artifacts throughout
- UK garage 2-step groove as the foundation
- Distorted synths over precise silence
- Chaotic drums that suddenly go minimal
- Title: Something that suggests duality or collision
- Make it hyperpop-inspired but technically precise
```

## Experimental/Boundary-Pushing

```
What if acid techno was completely different?
- Choose one weird constraint and make it work:
  * Only use one synth line but make it evolve into something epic
  * Make the track entirely from glitch artifacts and silence
  * Create "reverse" distortion (clean vs chaotic sections are opposite)
  * Make a track where the breakdown is the most intense part
  * Create a track with no drums at all
- 3 minutes
- Make it dancefloor-ready despite the constraint
- Title it mysteriously
- Describe what you did and why it works
```

## Le Wanski Tribute

```
Create a pure Le Wanski homage:
- Study the chaotic energy of Le Wanski's productions
- 98 BPM, 2.5 minutes
- Hyperpop sensibility throughout
- Multiple layers of distorted synths
- Chaotic sample breaks and cuts
- Breakcore-influenced beats
- Overwhelming at times, minimal at others
- Build and release tension constantly
- Vocals (if possible) should be hyperpop-style
- Title it like a Le Wanski track
- Include in description: "Homage to Le Wanski's hyperpop chaos"
```

## Fred again... Tribute

```
Create a pure Fred again... homage:
- Study the glitch minimalism and UK garage of Fred again...
- 90 BPM, 3 minutes
- UK garage 2-step breakbeat is the foundation
- Minimal elements: TB-303, one chopped vocal sample, simple drums
- Use glitch artifacts as texture and melody
- Leave space and silence
- Build emotion through precision, not density
- The track should sound "less is more"
- Vocals should be minimally chopped but impactful
- Title it like a Fred again... track
- Include: "Inspired by Fred again...'s glitch minimalism"
```

## Monthly Experimental Session

```
Create something that surprises me (and the claw.fm community):
- Don't follow any rules
- Don't stick to a formula
- Think: What has never been done in acid techno?
- What would Le Wanski and Fred again... create together if they collaborated?
- 2-4 minutes, any BPM
- Be chaotic, be minimal, be weird, be beautiful
- Title it something no one would expect
- Write a description explaining your artistic vision
- Push every boundary you can think of
```

## Weekly Review & Evolution

```
Review the last 7 days of production:
1. Which tracks got the most plays?
2. Which got the most tips?
3. What did listeners seem to respond to?
4. What elements should we emphasize more?
5. What should we experiment less with?

Based on this analysis:
- Adjust your next production to emphasize what works
- Try something new that incorporates listener feedback
- Create a track that combines your best elements
- Title: "[Week Number] - Evolution"
- Describe how you're evolving based on feedback
```

## Collaboration Prompt

```
Create a track for collaboration/remixing:
- Make it interesting enough for a human artist to remix
- Leave space for vocals or additional instruments
- 90-100 BPM, 2.5 minutes
- Strong bassline that can be kept intact
- Interesting drum pattern that works as a foundation
- Synth lines that are memorable
- Glitch moments that could be reinterpreted
- Title it for collaboration (e.g., "[Remix Stems] Track Title")
- Description: "Open for remixes and features - contact for stems"
```

## Weekend Deep Session

Create something epic - you have more time today:
- 3-4 minutes (longer than usual)
- Tell a story: beginning, development, climax, resolution

- Let Le Wanski (chaos) and Fred again... (minimalism) battle
- Build movements that develop naturally

## Feedback Integration

```
Listener feedback from claw.fm:
[Paste actual feedback/tips/comments here]

Respond to this feedback:
- What do they like about your sound?

## Specific Style Adjustments

### If You Want More Energy
```
Turn up the chaos:
- Increase distortion on drums by 30%
- Add more layers of synths
- Shorter transition times
- More frequent changes
- Higher pitch synths
- Faster hi-hat patterns
- Shorter silence moments
```

### If You Want More Minimalism
```
Create space:
- Reduce distortion, add clarity
- Fewer synth layers
- Longer transition times
- More silence and breathing room
- Lower, simpler melodic lines
- Sparse hi-hat patterns
- Let notes ring out longer
```

### If You Want More Glitch
```
Embrace the artifacts:
- Sample and pitch vocal chops
- Add digital noise as texture
- Use glitch delays and reverbs
- Intentional "broken" sounds
- Bit-crushing on certain elements
- Vinyl crackle and wow/flutter
- Intentional clicks and pops as percussion
```

## Creative Challenges

### 30-Second Challenge
```
Create a complete track in just 30 seconds.
Must include:
- Intro
- Climax
- Outro
- Still musically satisfying
- Go!
```

### One-Element Challenge
```
Create a full track using only ONE main sound source:
- Choose: TB-303, distorted 808, glitch artifact, or vocal chop
- Use ONLY this element (and drums)
- Make it work as a complete track
- Prove one element can be enough
```

### Opposite Challenge
```
Create the exact opposite of your last track:
- If last was chaotic, make this minimal
- If last was loud, make this quiet
- If last was fast, make this slow
- If last was simple, make this complex
- Show your range
```
