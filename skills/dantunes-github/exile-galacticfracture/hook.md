HOOK 1

Nova jolted awake, her eyes snapping open as reality rushed back in. The stark pale walls of the room sharpened into focus, cold and unyielding. Disoriented, she fought to steady herself, the lingering weight of the vision pressing against her mind.

Kael loomed above her, his expression tight with concern, an intensity she wasn’t used to seeing in him. His usually composed eyes now glinted with something uncommon.

“Nova, are you okay?” he asked, his voice tight. His hand hovered near her, as if he wanted to help her up but wasn’t sure if she’d accept it.

She blinked, disoriented. “I... I’m fine,” she said quietly, though her voice trembled. Her fingers twitched slightly, but she quickly balled her fists to hide it. Kael’s eyes flickered briefly to her hands. Just for an instant his expression tightened before he forced his face back to calm neutrality.

She tried to center herself, controlling her pulsation to a low frequency, as she pushed to her feet, but her tremors would not subside, like she was still halfway between the vision and reality. The room had gone strangely quiet, and it took her a moment to realize why.

Nova’s gaze settled on several figures clad entirely in black—a stark contrast to the soft, flowing pastel robes of the Harmony Keepers. Their armor gleamed with an unnatural, almost organic sheen, its segmented plates shifting fluidly like a living carapace. Their faces were hidden behind smooth, featureless masks, offering no hint of expression or intent.

The Harmony Keepers instinctively retreated, their serene presence eclipsed by the oppressive aura of these dark figures. Their silent, deliberate movements exuded purpose. Something cold, calculating, and utterly devoid of the harmony they claimed to protect. Nova felt the weight of their presence settle heavily in her chest, pressing like unseen chains.

“Kael,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “What’s going on?”

But Kael didn’t answer. His face had gone blank, his eyes hardening as he stared at the black-clad figures. She followed his gaze, her whole body pulsating as a deep sense of unease settled in her chest.

The Hall’s calm lighting didn’t change, but Nova’s translucence did. Her skin paling as her nuclei pulled tight. The air smelled filtered. Too clean. Her tremor ticked once in her palm, then again, sharper.

The black figures moved in unison, no swaying, no social rhythm. Just deliberate steps that didn’t belong in a Harmony room. One of the masks tilted, as if listening. Nova’s throat locked.

Then a voice, close.

“Nova.”

She turned sharply, her eyes locking onto Captain Zander, standing behind her. Now close by, he looked older, his face appeared worn. The long scar running across his cheek was a stark reminder of the past he had tried to bury—the rebellion, the defeat. He was a Veldriks, like her. An outcast. But here he was, standing tall amidst the chaos, his presence commanding despite the air of defeat that lingered around him.

“You need to leave.” Zander’s voice was low but unyielding, sharp with urgency. He took a step closer, his gaze cutting briefly to Kael before locking onto Nova. [SANITIZED] they’re here for you.”

Seeing Zander’s expression, grim and resolute, made her nuclei dim. This wasn’t a story. This was happening.

“W-What? Why?” Nova stammered, her mind racing.

Zander’s eyes softened for a brief moment, a glimmer of understanding. “It’s the [SANITIZED],” he said quietly. “You’ve attracted their attention, and trust me, you don’t want it.” He paused, then added with a knowing look, “We helped you before. We'll help you again.”

Nova’s nuclei spiraled in erratic patterns. Only one word in her mind…

[SANITIZED]

The tension in the room was suffocating. The Sentinels moved closer, their black-clad forms blending into the shadows as the atmosphere in the Harmony Hall grew thick with unease. Her body pulsating so hard she had trouble steadying her breathing, her hands filling with tremors, barely able to control them. She could feel Kael beside her, still as a statue, his eyes darting between the sentinels and Captain Zander.

Zander stepped forward, his presence commanding. Despite his past, despite everything, he still carried the weight of a former leader, and for a moment, the sentinels hesitated, as if some old instinct told them not to underestimate him again.

“You need to leave,” Zander said, his voice low and urgent. He looked directly at Nova, his expression sharp. “I’ll buy you some time, but you need to move.”

The reality of the situation hitting her all at once. “But, how?”

Zander didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he stepped into the path of the Sentinels, blocking their view of Nova and Kael. “Go,” he whispered over his shoulder. “I’ll buy you as much time as possible.”

Suddenly, Nova’s wrist panel flickered to life, and Spark’s voice chimed in, calm but urgent. “Nova, I’ve received access codes and coordinates for the Starport. Sender [SANITIZED].”

Zander’s gaze darted toward the advancing Sentinels, his expression tightening. He leaned in, his voice dropping to a hurried whisper, barely audible over the hum of distant machinery. “Dock 84B… old shop near the edge of the dock. Behind the counter—there’s a hidden door.” His sharp eyes flicked toward the Sentinels, “Spark has what you need from there.” His tone turned fierce. “Go!”

Nova nodded, her thoughts racing. She glanced at Kael, who gave her a small, determined nod, as if to say he was ready.

Zander’s voice broke through again. “Now!” he barked, turning back to the sentinels. He stood his ground, his presence commanding, and for a brief moment, Nova could feel the weight of his history. The rebel captain, fighting for freedom and independence. He was still fighting, still turning chaos into cover the way old stories said he had during the war.

“Spark,” Nova whispered urgently, her nuclei hitting her skin with force. “The meme. Override the screens. Now.”

“Yes, Nova,” Spark responded immediately, and within seconds, every screen and holo projector in the Harmony Hall flickered to life. The image of the cartoonish Belk and Harmony Keepers appeared, with their awkward grins and the flashing text: “I told Harmony! She said you must play with me!”

The absurdity of it felt like a spark of rebellion ignited into a roaring blaze. For the first time, Nova let it burn.

The effect was instantaneous.

The Harmony Keepers, normally so composed, froze in shock, their serene expressions turning to confusion and panic. “What... what is this?” one of them shouted, scrambling to shut off the screens. “This will disrupt the entire session!”

“Turn it off! Now!” another Keeper yelled, rushing to a terminal, frantically trying to remove the meme.

The room descended into chaos as the Order Sentinels faltered, momentarily caught between their pursuit of Nova and the growing disorder erupting around them. One of the Sentinels surged forward, reaching for her, but Zander intercepted him with a forceful shove, sending the sentinel stumbling back.

For a brief moment, Zander glanced toward Nova, catching sight of the ridiculous meme flashing across every holo-screen. A faint, almost approving smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. Defiance wrapped in absurdity. He couldn’t have planned it better himself.

“Let’s go,” Kael whispered, grabbing Nova’s arm and pulling her toward the exit.

They slipped out of the Harmony Hall, the cold night air biting at their skin as they hurried toward the Starport.

HOOK 2

As Nova entered the signal array’s main room, she spotted Kael at his usual desk, already immersed in his work. He was always early. Annoyingly early, she thought, but that was just his style. For Kael, being ‘on time’ was never an option; it was always about being prepared. Today was no exception.

He didn’t look up as she approached. His hands kept skating across the terminal’s interface, pulling windows open and shut with practiced precision. Yet the cursor paused mid-line. Just an instant of stillness, then resumed. He shifted half an inch to the left, making space beside his station without ever turning his head.

“Are you ready for today?” His voice broke the low hum of the machinery, steady, without looking at her. The question wasn’t casual, it never was when it came to Harmony Training. His tone was measured, almost too serious, as if he’d asked her about a mission rather than a mandatory session of forced integration.

Nova’s nuclei started to collide with each other inside her. The reminder made her want to sink into her seat. She opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, all the screens in the room lit up simultaneously, followed by the holo projectors flickering to life, casting images in the air around them. A flashing, goofy meme appeared on the largest screen. An exaggerated caricature of the Harmony Keepers with oversized heads and awkward grins, accompanied by a message that read:

Nothing says ‘Harmony’ like mandatory fun!

Nova couldn’t help the small grin that tugged at her lips. She glanced at Kael, waiting for him to laugh, or at least smile.

He did, just barely. His lips twitched, and he gave a small smirk, but it faded just as quickly as it had appeared. His eyes, however, remained fixed on her, that familiar seriousness settling back into his expression. “It’s important, Nova,” he said softly, his tone measured. “For you.”

He hesitated, the start of another thought catching in his throat. “Just… try not to draw attention today.” The words came out quiet, too carefully placed.

Nova’s nuclei dimmed while tapping her fingers against the desk. “You know,” she said, glancing at him with a faint smirk as her hand moved to the controls, “you’re really good at killing the fun when you get all… like this.”

With a quick tap, she removed the meme from the screens, the colorful caricatures flickering out of existence. “Yeah, sure,” she muttered, turning back to her console. Her tone carried a trace of sarcasm, but her gaze stayed fixed on the controls, deliberately avoiding his.

She caught the faint weight of his gaze lingering on her before he finally turned back to his own work. She shook her head, turning her focus back to the screen. Her fingers were trembling slightly over the console. She tensed, trying to still them. The tremors had started out small, but over time, they had worsened. It was one of the many symptoms of the Veldriks Syndrome. The gene defect made her body rebel against itself in the most frustrating ways. Her fingers twitched again, and she clenched her fists, willing them to stop.

Kael’s eyes flicked briefly toward her hands. A tiny, instinctive check before he schooled his expression back into calm neutrality.

“You’ll be fine,” he said quietly, his voice softer now, as if speaking directly to her pain, though he never outright acknowledged it. Kael’s presence was always like that. He knew the things that hurt her, the things that made her feel broken, but he never pushed too hard. Maybe that’s why she liked to have him around.

“Sure,” she muttered again, her gaze fixed on her console. Her fingers twitched again, this time violently enough to make her terminal buzz with an error message. She quickly withdrew her hands, her skin getting less translucent, paler.

It wasn’t long before the tension was interrupted by a small flicker of light near the corner of her desk. Nova glanced down and saw it. A small, delicately wrapped sweet, carefully placed where only she would notice. She blinked, surprised for a moment. A subtle warmth stirred in her chest, drawing a faint smile to her lips. Without a word, she picked up the sweet and slipped it into her coat pocket.

Nova’s fingers danced over the terminal with a precision that only came when she was in the flow of her work. The familiar rhythm of data, the quiet hum of the signal array, and the gentle pulse of the moving structure around her were calming in a way nothing else in her life was. It felt right. Here, she wasn’t a Veldriks. She wasn’t the outcast, the defect. She was just Nova, lost in the steady stream of the universe’s background noise.

“Spark,” she murmured, her focus on the algorithm display. “How’s the new sequence holding up?”

The small face she’d drawn onto her work AI blinked to life on her terminal. Spark’s synthetic voice responded, “Stable and integrating as expected. You’ll see an output in any moment now.”

Nova leaned in, her pulsation quickening. This was it. The algorithm was finally running, weaving through the chaos of static using the vibrations from the array’s migration—transforming disorder into something coherent. Weeks of meticulous tuning had led to this moment, but it was the mysterious hint from the message that unlocked the breakthrough. The possibility of extracting something real from the endless abyss sent a thrill through her—hope, sharp and electric.”

“Here it comes,” Spark announced as the data flickered on the screen. A familiar rush of static washed over the display. Background radiation, noise from distant stars and dead signals, but beneath it, something sharp cut through.

Her nuclei’s glow surging, “There... there is something here,” she whispered, more to herself than to Spark. Her fingers flew across the terminal, adjusting the parameters, focusing in on the signal. “Spark, analyze and pinpoint the origin.”

“Calculating…” Spark’s tone held a faint note of curiosity beneath its neutral cadence. After a moment, the display lit up, revealing two sets of coordinates measured in n’geeds—16.72 and 0.13.

Nova frowned. “What… two distances?” Her fingers hesitated over the console, her mind racing. Split coordinates did not make sense. Yet the signal had come through clearer than anything she’d detected in ages.

“Sixteen point seven two… zero point one three…” she repeated slowly, her mind racing. A far-off system in the outer arms of [SANITIZED] shouldn’t have produced two distinct readings. It defied everything she understood about signal processing.

Nova sat back, trying to make sense of it. Did she just catch a signal from another galaxy? She’d never seen anything like this before. A signal that traveled across the vast expanse of space, from a galaxy beyond their own? It was almost too perfect.

“What are the odds?” she whispered, almost to herself.

The double readout wasn’t just strange, it was… inconvenient. The sort of datapoint the textbooks politely ignored because it refused to behave. Nova’s hands started to tremble. If the universe wasn’t matching the rules, maybe it was time to update the rules.

She glanced over at Kael, who sat at his station across the room, already focused on his own terminal. His calm, measured expression never changed.

“I think we’ve got something,” Nova said, her voice rising slightly with excitement. She turned the display toward him, the coordinates of the signal flashing in the center. “Sixteen point seven two n’geeds, Kael. It’s from the [SANITIZED]. What are the odds?”

Kael leaned in a fraction closer than usual, not out of excitement, but as if evaluating her rather than the data.

“[SANITIZED]?” He raised an eyebrow, leaning back in his chair with studied nonchalance. “Don’t get too excited. That sector’s notorious for false positives.”

His gaze lingered a moment longer on the dual readings—16.72 and 0.13 n’geeds—before shifting back to his work. “Two distances from the same signal?” he added, his voice still casual but edged with skepticism. “Most probably a glitch in the calibration.”

Nova clenched her jaw, resisting the urge to fire back. False positives or not, there was something off about this. Something real. She could feel it.

“Look here,” said Kael, tapping a few keys on his terminal and pulling up a log on his own screen. “Signals from that sector always seem promising, but it’s just proximity noise. Too distant to be reliable. I’ve seen it before, it’s usually nothing.”

Nova frowned, glancing back at her terminal. “But this feels different, Kael. It’s clearer than anything we’ve picked up from outside our own [SANITIZED].”

Kael shrugged, giving her a small smile that almost masked the tension in his eyes. “Could be. But something so distant, your algorithm is probably just finding a pattern in the random noise by chance.”

Before she could respond, all the screens and holo projectors lit up in the room again, projecting another set of images. This time, memes of the first Kezurai that started to explore space bloomed across the walls. An ancient ship cartoonishly spiraling through space with a caption: ‘We’ve got contact... or cosmic dust!’

Nova couldn’t help but laugh. She’d programmed that one, too. Her own little inside joke with Spark. She glanced at Kael, expecting him to join in the humor, but his smile didn’t quite reach his eyes this time. He simply gave her a small nod and said, “I would not spend any more time on it, you are just wasting time and effort.” His tone was light, almost casual, but the way his gaze lingered on her reaction was anything but.

The words made her pause. Why was he downplaying it? It wasn’t like Kael to brush things off. He was always measured but focused. Her instinct told her this was more than just a routine glitch, but she couldn’t quite pinpoint why his tone made her feel uneasy. She turned back to the screen, doubt creeping into her thoughts.

Then, out of nowhere, the data stream sputtered. A cascade of error messages flooded the terminal, the bright colors of the memes disappearing, replaced with red warnings flashing across every holo display in the room. One by one, the systems started to fail, the data deleting itself, the signal disappearing as if it had never existed.

Nova’s hands flew to the controls. “What—what’s happening?” Nuclei raced inside her as she scrambled to stop the error messages from flooding the system, but it was too late. The entire array was resetting, wiping the memory as though the signal had never been there.

Kael glanced at her screen, then back at his own, his expression calm. “It’s probably just a glitch the new algorithm created that crashed the system. I mean we did get a double distance reading, so it is purging everything to return to a stable state.”

Nova stared at the terminal, frustration rising. “But... no, Kael. I saw it. We had it. The signal was real.”

Kael shrugged again, his voice casual. “If it was, we will pick something up again.”

Nova opened her mouth, but no words came out. Hastily her gaze slid back to the screen on instinct, as if the data might still be lingering out of courtesy. It wasn’t, but the afterimage was. A shape that didn’t belong. A spike that had no right to be there. She closed her eyes, annoyed at herself trying to see it in her mind:

Forbidden

Sanitizing data…

She opened her eyes again, unsure if she had imagined it. The word had flashed on the screen for an instant, almost too fast to catch. “Did you... did you see anything weird right before the crash?”

Kael’s gaze was steady. “Weird?”

“Like... I don’t know. Something about it felt off.” She rubbed her eyes, trying to shake the lingering feeling of unease. The signal was gone, and with it, her chance at discovering whatever had just slipped through their system.

Kael offered her a reassuring smile, one she wasn’t sure she believed. “It happens. We can run it again in our next shift. You’ll see—it’s probably just the algorithm pushing the system over the limit.”

Nova nodded absently, but the word “Forbidden” stuck with her, like a whisper she couldn’t shake. She wasn’t sure if it was the signal, or something else entirely, but she knew one thing for certain. Something had been there.

Before the details could blur, she forced herself to replay them. The twin distances, the pattern of the spike, the “Forbidden”. She whispered all of it to herself, over and over, until they stuck. If the system wanted to pretend nothing had happened, fine. She would remember for both of them.

The error messages still echoed in Nova’s mind as she aimlessly tapped at her terminal. The excitement that had surged through her earlier had drained away, leaving her feeling deflated and hollow. The signal—the one moment she thought might lead to something different—was gone, being wiped from the system as if it had never existed. Her fingers moved mechanically, acknowledging the routine system updates without any real attention.
