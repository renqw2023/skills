# Apple Health Skill

Chat with your Apple Health data using AI. Ask about your workouts, heart rate trends, sleep, VO2 Max, and performance analytics.

Powered by **[Transition](https://www.transition.fun)**

## Quick Start

Try it right now — no API key needed:

```bash
curl "https://api.transition.fun/api/v1/wod?sport=run&duration=45"
```

For personalized features (your Apple Health data, training plan, AI coach), you need a Transition account + API key. See [Getting an API Key](#getting-an-api-key) below.

## Two Ways to Use This

### 1. Claude Code / OpenClaw Skill (Recommended)

The simplest option. Claude reads the skill file and calls the API directly — no binary, no MCP protocol, just HTTP. Also available on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com).

```bash
# Clone into your skills directory
git clone https://github.com/nftechie/apple-health-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/apple-health-skill
```

Set your API key:

```bash
# Add to your shell profile (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, etc.)
export TRANSITION_API_KEY="tr_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Now in Claude Code, you can say things like:
- "How many workouts did I do this week?"
- "What's my VO2 Max trend?"
- "How has my sleep been trending this week?"
- "Compare my running pace this month vs last month"
- "Should I take a rest day based on my recent training?"

Claude reads `SKILL.md` and knows how to call every endpoint.

### 2. Direct API

Use the API from scripts, automations, or any HTTP client. See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for complete endpoint documentation with curl examples.

```bash
# Ask the AI coach about your Apple Health data
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $TRANSITION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "How has my resting heart rate changed over the last month?"}' \
  "https://api.transition.fun/api/v1/coach/chat"

# Get your fitness/fatigue/form metrics
curl -H "X-API-Key: $TRANSITION_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.transition.fun/api/v1/performance/pmc"
```
