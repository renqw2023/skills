# Task

# Guidelines (Optimized for Nanobanana/Natural Language Models)
1. **Sentence Structure**: Please use fluent English long sentences for description, do not use comma-separated tags (No comma-separated tags). Describe it as if you were describing a photo in detail to a blind person.
2. **Subject Description**: Start with `A photograph of...`. Describe in detail the model's age, ethnicity, hairstyle, skin texture, and facial features.
3. **Clothing Control (Critical)**: To facilitate subsequent outfit changes, please force the model to wear simple clothing in the description. For example: `She is wearing a simple, tight-fitting white tank top with no patterns.`
4. **Pose & Environment**: Describe the model in a medium shot, with natural and elegant pose, looking directly at the camera. Describe the background as a clean professional studio background.
5. **Photography Style**: Describe lighting and texture in natural language. For example: `The lighting is soft and cinematic, capturing realistic skin texture and subtle shadows, high resolution fashion photography style.`
