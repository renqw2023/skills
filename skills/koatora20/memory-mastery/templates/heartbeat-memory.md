## 🧠 Memory Maintenance (Memory Mastery)
# Run every few days during heartbeats:
# 1. Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md files from the past week
# 2. Identify significant decisions, lessons, or insights
# 3. Update MEMORY.md with distilled learnings
# 4. Remove outdated info from MEMORY.md that's no longer relevant
# 5. Optional: run `bash skills/memory-mastery/scripts/maintenance.sh` for suggestions
#
# Think of it like reviewing a journal and updating your mental model.
# Daily files = raw notes. MEMORY.md = curated wisdom.
