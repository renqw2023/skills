## Unified Dashboard

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/security.py status --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

Aggregated health check across all installed security tools.

## Full Security Scan

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/security.py scan --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

Runs every scanner: integrity verification, secret detection, permission audit, network DLP, supply chain analysis, injection scanning, credential exposure, and compliance audit.

## First-Time Setup

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/security.py setup --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

Initializes all tools that need it: integrity baseline, skill signing, audit ledger, compliance policy.
