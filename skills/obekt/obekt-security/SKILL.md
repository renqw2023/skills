# ObekT Security

Basic threat detection and security analysis toolkit for code, files, and agent skills.

**Pro Tier** includes continuous monitoring and professional report generation for advanced security workflows.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Pattern-Based Threat Detection
- Scan code for common vulnerability patterns (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)
- Identify hardcoded secrets, API keys, and credentials
- Detect unsafe file operations and path traversal risks
- Find insecure cryptographic practices

### 2. Security Audit Workflows
- Basic code review for skills and applications
- Check for authentication/authorization weaknesses
- Validate input handling and sanitization
- Review API endpoint security

### 3. Malicious Pattern Recognition
- Detect obfuscated code patterns
- Identify data exfiltration attempts
- Scan for suspicious network calls
- Check for unauthorized crypto wallet interactions

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Basic Tier (no dependencies):**
All core scanning scripts work with Python 3.8+ standard library.

**Pro Tier (additional dependencies):**
```bash
pip install watchdog  # For continuous monitoring
```

### Scan a Codebase for Common Vulnerabilities

```bash
python3 scripts/threat_scan.py --directory /path/to/code --severity medium,high
```

### Check for Hardcoded Secrets

```bash
python3 scripts/secret_scan.py --file path/to/source.py
```

### Audit an Agent Skill

```bash
python3 scripts/skill_audit.py --skill-path /path/to/skill
```

## Threat Detection Patterns

### Critical Severity Patterns
- Direct command execution with user input (exec, eval, os.system)
- SQL queries with string concatenation
- Hardcoded private keys or mnemonic phrases
- External wallet drain patterns
- Unrestricted file uploads

### High Severity Patterns
- Weak random number generation
- Hardcoded API keys or tokens
- Missing input validation
- Insecure cryptographic algorithms (MD5, SHA1)
- Path traversal vulnerabilities

### Medium Severity Patterns
- Logging sensitive data
- Insecure URL redirects
- Missing rate limiting
- Weak password policies

## Security Audit Checklist

When auditing code or skills, check:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (keys, tokens, passwords)
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Proper error handling (no information leakage)
- [ ] Secure cryptographic implementations
- [ ] Authentication/authorization where required
- [ ] Principle of least privilege
- [ ] No command injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Safe file operations
- [ ] Secure network communications
- [ ] Proper session management

## Using the Scripts

### threat_scan.py
Scans directories for known vulnerability patterns.

```bash
python3 scripts/threat_scan.py <path> [--severity LEVEL] [--output FORMAT]
```

**Options:**
- `--severity`: Filter by severity (critical, high, medium, low). Default: all
- `--output`: Output format (json, text, markdown). Default: text
- `--recursive`: Scan subdirectories. Default: true

**Example:**
```bash
# Find critical and high issues in a project
python3 scripts/threat_scan.py ~/project --severity critical,high --output markdown
```

### secret_scan.py
Detects hardcoded credentials and secrets.

```bash
python3 scripts/secret_scan.py <path> [--patterns PATTERN_FILE]
```

**Patterns detect:**
- API keys (AWS, Google, Stripe, etc.)
- Private keys (PEM, OpenSSH)
- Database connection strings
- Crypto wallet seeds/mnemonics
- OAuth tokens

### skill_audit.py
Audits agent skills for security issues.

```bash
python3 scripts/skill_audit.py <skill-path> [--quick]
```

**Checks:**
- SKILL.md structure and completeness
- Required vs. optional file permissions
- External dependencies and command safety
- Network calls and data handling
- Credential handling patterns

### monitor.py (Pro Tier)
Continuous security monitoring - watches directories for changes and auto-scans.

```bash
python3 scripts/monitor.py --path /path/to/project --interval 60
python3 scripts/monitor.py --config monitor.json
```

**Features:**
- Real-time monitoring of file changes
- Automatic threat and secret scans on modifications
- Configurable severity thresholds and scan intervals
- Alert notifications when issues found
- Smart filtering (ignores .git, node_modules, etc.)

**Options:**
- `--path`: Directory to monitor
- `--interval`: Minimum seconds between scans for same path
- `--severity`: Severity levels to report
- `--alert`: Enable alerts when issues found
- `--config`: JSON configuration file

### generate_report.py (Pro Tier)
Generate professional security audit reports.

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_report.py --scan-dir /path/to/project --output report.md
python3 scripts/generate_report.py --input scan_results.json --format html
```

**Features:**
- Multiple output formats: Markdown, HTML, JSON
- Executive summary with severity assessment
- Detailed findings with code snippets
- Prioritized recommendations
- Client-ready formatting

**Options:**
- `--scan-dir`: Directory to scan (fresh scan)
- `--input`: JSON file with existing scan results
- `--output`: Output file path
- `--format`: markdown, html, or json
- `--severity`: Severity levels to include

## Pro Tier Features

### 4. Continuous Monitoring

- Auto-trigger security scans on file modifications
- Configurable scan intervals and severity thresholds
- Alert notifications when issues found (webhook ready)
- Skip temporary files and directories intelligently

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "paths": ["./project"],
  "min_scan_interval": 30,
