# Odoo Financial Intelligence

**Read-only, Evidence-First, Ledger-Based Reports**

## Security & Credentials

### Required Environment Variables

This skill requires Odoo connection credentials stored in `assets/autonomous-cfo/.env`:

| Variable | Description | Secret |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `ODOO_URL` | Odoo instance URL (e.g., `https://your-odoo.com`) | No |
| `ODOO_DB` | Odoo database name | No |
| `ODOO_USER` | Odoo username/email | No |
| `ODOO_PASSWORD` | Odoo password or API key | **Yes** |

**Setup:**
```bash
cd skills/odoo/assets/autonomous-cfo
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual credentials
nano .env
```

### Model Invocation Policy

**Model invocation is DISABLED** for this skill. It must be explicitly invoked by the user.

**Reason:** The skill handles sensitive financial data and connects to external Odoo instances. Autonomous invocation could expose confidential accounting data or trigger unwanted external connections.

### Data Handling

- **Read-only:** All mutating methods (`create`, `write`, `unlink`, etc.) are blocked at the client level
- **No exfiltration:** Reports are generated locally in `assets/autonomous-cfo/output/`
- **Network endpoints:** Only connects to the Odoo URL specified in `.env`
- **Output formats:** PDF, Excel, and WhatsApp image cards (local files only)

### Installation

The skill requires a Python virtual environment with specific packages:

```bash
cd skills/odoo/assets/autonomous-cfo
./install.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd skills/odoo/assets/autonomous-cfo
python3 -m venv venv
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependencies:** `requests`, `matplotlib`, `pillow`, `fpdf2`, `openpyxl`

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER assume** - Always ask clarifying questions before generating reports
2. **Multi-company check** - If multiple companies exist, ASK which one to use
3. **Ledger-based** - Use Chart of Accounts and journal entries (account.move.line), not just invoice summaries
4. **Verify periods** - Confirm date ranges with user before running
5. **No silent defaults** - Every assumption must be confirmed

## Before Any Report, Ask:

1. "Which company should I use?" (if multiple exist)
2. "What period? (from/to dates)"
3. "Which accounts or account types to include?"
4. "Any specific breakdown needed?" (by account, by partner, by journal, etc.)
5. "Output format preference?" (PDF, WhatsApp cards, or both)

## Entrypoint

Uses the venv with fpdf2, matplotlib, pillow for proper PDF/chart generation:

```bash
./skills/odoo/assets/autonomous-cfo/venv/bin/python ./skills/odoo/assets/autonomous-cfo/src/tools/cfo_cli.py <command>
```

Or from the skill directory:
```bash
cd skills/odoo/assets/autonomous-cfo && ./venv/bin/python src/tools/cfo_cli.py <command>
```

## Chart of Accounts Based Reporting

Reports should be built from:
- `account.account` - Chart of Accounts structure (code, name, type, internal_group)
- `account.move.line` - Journal entry lines (debit, credit, account_id, date)
- `account.journal` - Source journals (type: sale, purchase, cash, bank, general)

### Account Internal Groups
- **ASSET** - Assets (current, non-current, cash, receivables)
- **LIABILITY** - Liabilities (payables, taxes, accrued)
- **EQUITY** - Owner's equity
- **INCOME** - Revenue accounts
- **EXPENSE** - Cost and expense accounts
- **OFF_BALANCE** - Off-balance sheet accounts

### Common Account Types
- `asset_cash` - Bank and cash accounts
- `asset_receivable` - Accounts receivable
- `asset_current` - Current assets
- `liability_payable` - Accounts payable
- `income` - Revenue
- `expense` - Expenses

### Special Equity Types (Odoo-Specific)
- `equity` - Standard equity accounts (share capital, retained earnings)
- `equity_unaffected` - **Suspense account** for undistributed profits/losses (e.g., 999999)

**CRITICAL for Balance Sheet:**
Odoo's `equity_unaffected` is a SUSPENSE account. Do NOT use its ledger balance directly.

**Correct Equity Calculation:**
1. **Equity Proper** (type: `equity`) - Use ledger balance (credit - debit)
2. **Retained Earnings** (prior years) - Ledger balance from `equity_unaffected`
3. **Current Year Earnings** - Compute real-time: Income - Expenses

```
Total Equity = Equity Proper + Retained Earnings + Current Year Earnings
```

Where Current Year Earnings = Σ(income credit-debit) - Σ(expense debit-credit)

**Why this matters:** Odoo computes Current Year Earnings in real-time on the Balance Sheet. Using only the `equity_unaffected` ledger balance will cause the balance sheet to NOT balance.

## Automatic Reporting Standard Detection

The skill automatically detects the company's accounting standard based on country/jurisdiction and formats reports accordingly.

**Supported Standards:**
| Standard | Jurisdiction | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| IFRS | International | Default for most countries |
| US GAAP | United States | SEC registrants |
| Ind-AS | India | Indian GAAP converged with IFRS |
| UK GAAP | United Kingdom | FRS 102 |
| SOCPA | Saudi Arabia | IFRS adopted |
| EU IFRS | European Union | IAS Regulation |
| CAS | China | Chinese Accounting Standards |
| JGAAP | Japan | Japanese GAAP |
| ASPE | Canada | Private enterprises |
| AASB | Australia | Australian standards |

**Detection Logic:**
1. Query company's country from `res.company`
2. Map country code to reporting standard
3. Apply standard-specific formatting:
   - Number format (1,234.56 vs 1.234,56)
   - Negative display ((123) vs -123)
   - Date format (DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY)
   - Statement titles (Balance Sheet vs Statement of Financial Position)
   - Cash flow method (indirect vs direct)

**Override:**
```python
# Force a specific standard
reporter.generate(..., standard="US_GAAP")
```

## Commands

### Pre-built Reports

```bash
# Financial Health - cash flow, liquidity, burn rate, runway
cfo_cli.py health --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD --company-id ID

# Revenue Analytics - MoM trends, top customers
cfo_cli.py revenue --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD --company-id ID

# AR/AP Aging - overdue buckets
cfo_cli.py aging --as-of YYYY-MM-DD --company-id ID

# Expense Breakdown - by vendor/category
cfo_cli.py expenses --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD --company-id ID

# Executive Summary - one-page CFO snapshot
cfo_cli.py executive --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD --company-id ID
```

### Ad-hoc Reports

```bash
# Custom comparison
cfo_cli.py adhoc --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD --metric-a "revenue" --metric-b "expenses"

# Examples:
cfo_cli.py adhoc --metric-a "cash in" --metric-b "cash out"
cfo_cli.py adhoc --metric-a "direct expenses" --metric-b "indirect expenses"
```

### Output Formats

```bash
--output whatsapp   # Dark theme 1080x1080 PNG cards
--output pdf        # Light theme A4 PDF
--output excel      # Excel workbook (.xlsx)
--output both       # PDF + WhatsApp cards
--output all        # PDF + Excel + WhatsApp cards
```

## Automatic Visualizations

**Reports always include appropriate visualizations by default:**

| Report | Auto-Included Charts |
|--------|---------------------|
| Financial Health | Cash position, burn rate trend, runway |
| Revenue | MoM trend, top customers, growth KPI |
| AR/AP Aging | Aging buckets pie, overdue highlights |
| Expenses | Category breakdown, trend, top vendors |
| Executive | All KPI cards, summary charts |
| Balance Sheet | Asset/liability composition |
| P&L | Revenue vs expense, margin trend |
| Cash Flow | Operating breakdown, cash trend |

**Rule:** If visualization makes the report clearer, include it automatically. Never ask "do you want charts?" — just add them.

## Interactive Param Collection

If required params are missing, the skill will ask:

1. **Company:** "Which company?" (list available options)
2. **Period:** "What period? (e.g., 'last month', 'Q4 2024', custom dates)"
3. **Accounts:** "Which accounts or groups?" (e.g., 'all income', 'bank accounts only')
4. **Breakdown:** "Group by? (Month, Customer, Category, Account)"
5. **Output:** "Output format? (WhatsApp cards, PDF, Both)"

## How to Use in Chat

Just ask naturally:

- "Give me a financial health report for last quarter"
- "Show revenue vs expenses for the past 6 months"
- "What's my AR aging?"
- "Generate an executive summary for this month"
- "Show me profit & loss statement based on chart of accounts"

The skill will:
1. Check for multiple companies and ask which one
2. Parse your request
3. Ask for any missing info
4. Fetch data from Odoo using ledger entries
5. Generate charts + PDF
6. Deliver via WhatsApp cards and/or PDF

## Hard Rules

1. Odoo RPC output is source of truth
2. Strict read-only (no create/write/unlink)
3. No proactive actions unless requested
4. Every number includes methodology note
5. Always verify with user before assuming
6. **Always include visualizations** - If a report benefits from charts/graphs, include them automatically without asking. Reports should be visually complete.

## Diagnostics

```bash
python3 ./skills/odoo/assets/autonomous-cfo/src/tools/cfo_cli.py doctor
```

## Report Themes

- **WhatsApp Cards:** "Midnight Ledger" — Navy-black (#0a0e1a), copper glow (#cd7f32)
- **PDF Reports:** Clean white, copper accents, professional layout
