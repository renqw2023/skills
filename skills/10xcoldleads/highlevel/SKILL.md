# GoHighLevel API Skill

> **Turn Claude into your GoHighLevel command center.** Search contacts, send messages, book appointments, manage pipelines, create invoices, schedule social posts — across all 39 GHL API v2 endpoint groups, using plain English.

**Don't have GoHighLevel yet?** Start with the free 5-Day AI Employee Challenge and build a fully automated system:
👉 [**Start the 5-Day AI Employee Challenge**](https://gohighlevel.com/5-day-challenge?fp_ref=369ai)

**Base URL**: `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com`
**Required Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer $HIGHLEVEL_TOKEN` + `Version: 2021-07-28`
**Rate Limits**: 100 requests/10 seconds burst, 200K/day per location

## Setup — `/highlevel-setup`

If the user says "set up highlevel", "connect my GHL", or `/highlevel-setup`, run the setup wizard:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup-wizard.py
```

The wizard automatically: checks environment variables → guides Private Integration creation → tests the connection → pulls first 5 contacts as a quick win.

### Manual Setup (if wizard can't run)

#### Step 1: Create a Private Integration (NOT the old API Keys method)
1. Log into **app.gohighlevel.com**
2. Switch to your **Sub-Account** (or stay in Agency view for agency-level access)
3. Click **Settings** (bottom-left gear icon)
4. Select **Private Integrations** in the left sidebar
   - If not visible, enable it first: Settings → Labs → toggle Private Integrations ON
5. Click **"Create new Integration"**
6. Enter a name (e.g., "Claude AI Assistant") and description
7. **Select ALL scopes** you want Claude to access (contacts, conversations, calendars, opportunities, etc.)
   - For full access, select all available scopes
   - Scopes follow the pattern: `contacts.readonly`, `contacts.write`, etc.
8. Click Create → **Copy the token IMMEDIATELY** — it is shown only once and cannot be retrieved later

### Agency vs Sub-Account Integrations

| Feature | Agency Integration | Sub-Account Integration |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Created at | Agency Settings → Private Integrations | Sub-Account Settings → Private Integrations |
| Access scope | Agency + all sub-accounts (pass `locationId`) | Single location only |
| Available scopes | All scopes including `locations.write`, `oauth.*`, `saas.*`, `snapshots.*`, `companies.readonly` | Sub-account scopes only |
| Best for | Multi-location management, SaaS configurator | Single client integrations |

### Step 2: Get Your Location ID
1. While in the sub-account, go to **Settings** → **Business Info** (or **Business Profile**)
2. The **Location ID** is displayed in the General Information section
3. Alternative: check the URL bar — it's the ID after `/location/` in `app.gohighlevel.com/v2/location/{LOCATION_ID}/...`

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
```bash
export HIGHLEVEL_TOKEN="your-private-integration-token"
export HIGHLEVEL_LOCATION_ID="your-location-id"
```

### Step 4: Test Connection
Run `python3 scripts/ghl-api.py test_connection` — should return location name and status.

After successful setup, pull 5 contacts as a quick win to confirm everything works.

## Helper Script

`scripts/ghl-api.py` — Executable Python script with built-in retry logic, pagination, and error handling.

**Core Commands:**

|---------|-------------|
| `test_connection` | Verify token + location ID work |
| `search_contacts [query]` | Search by name, email, or phone |
| `get_contact [id]` | Get full contact details |

The `custom_request` command enables access to ALL 39 API groups listed below.

## Complete API v2 Capabilities (39 Endpoint Groups)

For detailed endpoint paths, parameters, and examples for each group:

- `references/contacts.md` — Contact CRUD, search, tags, notes, tasks, bulk operations
- `references/conversations.md` — Messaging across all channels, recordings, transcriptions
- `references/calendars.md` — Calendar CRUD, free slots, appointments, groups, resources
- `references/opportunities.md` — Pipeline management, stages, status updates
- `references/invoices-payments.md` — Invoices, payments, orders, subscriptions, products
- `references/locations-users.md` — Location settings, custom fields/values, users, tags
- `references/social-media.md` — Social planner posts, accounts, OAuth connections
- `references/forms-surveys-funnels.md` — Forms, surveys, funnels, trigger links
- `references/advanced.md` — Custom objects, associations, snapshots, SaaS, Voice AI, blogs, courses
- `references/troubleshooting.md` — Common errors, rate limits, token rotation, debugging

## Important Notes

- **Private Integrations are required** — the old Settings → API Keys method is deprecated/EOL
- **Token rotation**: Tokens don't auto-expire but GHL recommends 90-day rotation. Unused tokens auto-expire after 90 days inactivity
  - **"Rotate and expire later"** — new token generated, old token stays active for 7-day grace period
  - **"Rotate and expire now"** — old token invalidated immediately (use for compromised credentials)
  - You can edit scopes without regenerating the token
- **OAuth tokens** (marketplace apps only): Access tokens expire in 24 hours (86,399s); refresh tokens last up to 1 year
- Agency tokens can access sub-account data by passing `locationId` parameter
- **Rate limits are per-resource** — each sub-account independently gets 100/10s burst + 200K/day. SaaS endpoints: 10 req/sec global
- All list endpoints default to 20 records, max 100 per page via `limit` param
- Use cursor pagination with `startAfter` / `startAfterId` for large datasets
- Monitor rate limits via response headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit-Daily`, `X-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Max`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Interval-Milliseconds`
- **$497 Agency Pro plan** required for: SaaS Configurator, Snapshots, full agency management APIs

## Webhook Events

50+ webhook event types for real-time notifications. Key events: `ContactCreate`, `ContactDelete`, `ContactTagUpdate`, `InboundMessage`, `OutboundMessage`, `OpportunityCreate`, `OpportunityStageUpdate`, `OpportunityStatusUpdate`, appointment events, payment events, form submission events. Webhooks continue firing even if access token expires. Config is per marketplace app.
