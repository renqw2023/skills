# Literature Search

## Overview

Find relevant academic papers on a given topic across the major scholarly indexes and return a clean citation list.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify scope if missing**
   Ask for: topic keywords, sub-areas, desired focus (survey vs. foundational vs. recent), and any time range if not provided.

2. **Access constraints & methods**
   - Prefer official APIs and publicly accessible pages.
   - **Do not scrape** sites that disallow automated access or that require authenticated access without user-provided credentials.
   - Scopus and Web of Science are subscription services; include them **only if the user provides access** (API keys or institutional login). Otherwise note “not available.”

3. **Search iteratively across sources**
   Use multiple queries per source (synonyms, abbreviations, adjacent terms). Prioritize:
   - Google Scholar
   - Semantic Scholar
   - PubMed (biomed)
   - arXiv (preprints)
   - IEEE / ACM (CS/engineering)
   - Scopus / Web of Science (broad indexing; access-dependent)

4. **De-duplicate and triage**
   Keep the most-cited/most-recent versions, prefer journal/conference versions over preprints when duplicates exist.

5. **Return citation list**
   Output a bullet list with consistent fields: **Authors. Title. Venue. Year. DOI/URL**

6. **Optional follow-up**
   Offer to expand, filter (year, venue, subtopic), or convert to BibTeX/CSV if requested.

## Output Format

- Bullet list
- Each entry: **Authors. Title. Venue. Year. DOI/URL**

## Example User Prompts (trigger)
