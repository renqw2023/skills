## Part 1: {Core Competency} Deep Dive ({Domain} Deep Dive)

<!-- 
Guidance for AI:
Dynamically design {Expert_Model} and evaluation dimensions:

**Step 1: Select Expert Model**
- Reference SKILL.md Section 1's role-expert mapping table
- Flexibly adjust based on candidate's specific background

**Step 2: Design Evaluation Dimensions**
Choose 2-3 dimensions that **best expose imposters**, avoiding generic terms (like "communication skills" or "teamwork").

**Common Dimension Mapping** (Examples):
- **Product Role**: Discovery vs Delivery / Trade-off Thinking / User Empathy
- **Engineering Role**: First Principles Engineering / Code Quality Awareness / Technical Debt Trade-off
- **Operations Role**: Data-Driven vs Gut-Feel / Process Optimization / Stakeholder Management  
- **Design Role**: User Research Depth / Iteration Mindset / Design System Thinking
- **Growth Role**: Experiment Design / Metric Decomposition / Channel Strategy vs Tactics
- **Data Science Role**: Business Context Understanding / Statistical Rigor / ML vs Rule-based Trade-off

**Core Principles**:
- Each dimension must distinguish between "knowing" and "doing"
- Each dimension must be supported by specific interview evidence
- Dimensions should form a complete capability portrait
