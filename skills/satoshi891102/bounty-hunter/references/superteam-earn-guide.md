# Superteam Earn — Platform Guide

## Overview
Superteam Earn (earn.superteam.fun) is the primary bounty platform in the Solana ecosystem. It hosts bounties from Solana projects, foundations, and companies.

## Bounty Types

### Content
- Twitter/X threads about a project
- Blog posts / articles

- Infographics

- Smart contract development
- SDK implementations
- API integrations

### Design
- UI/UX design for dApps
- Brand identity work
- Marketing assets
- Landing page design

## Key Fields to Check

1. **Region** — Many bounties are region-locked (Nigeria, India, Vietnam, etc.). If it says a specific country, skip it unless you're there.
2. **Prize distribution** — Some are winner-take-all, some split among top N, some give participation rewards
3. **Deadline** — Hard deadlines. No extensions.
4. **Submissions count** — Visible on the bounty page. Lower = better odds.
5. **Sponsor history** — Check if sponsor has paid out previous bounties

## Profile Requirements

To submit bounties, you need a complete Superteam Earn profile:
- Wallet address (Solana)
- Twitter/X account linked
- Bio and skills filled out
- Some bounties require additional verification

## Tips for Winning

1. **Quality over speed** — Don't rush to be first. Be the best.
2. **Read past winners** — Same sponsors often have consistent preferences
3. **Go deep** — Surface-level submissions lose. Show genuine understanding.
4. **Format matters** — Clean formatting, proper headings, no walls of text
5. **Engage with the project** — Use their product before writing about it
6. **Original data wins** — On-chain analysis, unique research, proprietary insights

## Red Flags (Skip These)

- Sponsor with no previous bounties and no verified presence
- Extremely vague requirements ("write something about our project")
- Prize seems too good to be true relative to effort
- Region-locked to somewhere you're not
- Requires KYC/identity verification you can't provide
