# Torch Liquidation Bot

A skill that monitors Torch Market lending positions across all tokens, profiles borrower wallets for risk, and predicts which loans are likely to fail. In bot mode, it can execute liquidations on positions that have crossed the on-chain threshold.

## What This Skill Does

This skill scans lending markets on [Torch Market](https://torch.market), a fair-launch DAO launchpad on Solana. Every migrated token on Torch has a built-in lending market where holders can borrow SOL against their tokens. When a borrower's collateral drops in value and their loan-to-value ratio exceeds 65%, the position becomes liquidatable on-chain per the protocol's rules.

The skill's core value is **risk analysis** -- it profiles borrowers, tracks price trends, and scores every loan by how likely it is to fail. In `info` mode (no wallet required), it's purely a read-only dashboard. In `bot` mode, it can act on positions that cross the protocol threshold.

## How It Works

```
scan all tokens with active lending
         |
    for each token:
         |
    find all borrowers with active loans
         |
    profile each borrower (SAID reputation + trade history)
         |
    score each loan (4-factor risk model)
         |
    if liquidatable + profitable → execute liquidation
    if high risk → keep watching closely
```

### Three Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Requires Wallet |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `info` (default) | Display lending parameters for a token or all tokens | no |
| `bot` | Scan and score positions; execute liquidations when threshold is met | yes |
| `watch` | Monitor your own loan health in real-time | yes |

### Risk Scoring

Every loan is scored 0-100 on four weighted factors:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| LTV proximity | 40% | How close the position is to the 65% liquidation threshold |
| Price momentum | 30% | Is the collateral token's price trending down? (linear regression on recent snapshots) |
| Wallet risk | 20% | SAID trust tier + trade win/loss ratio. Low-reputation wallets with losing histories score higher |
| Interest burden | 10% | How much accrued interest is eating into the collateral margin |

Positions scoring above the configurable risk threshold (default: 60) are flagged as high-risk and monitored more closely.

## Architecture

```
packages/bot/src/
├── types.ts            — all interfaces and contracts
├── config.ts           — env vars → typed config
├── logger.ts           — structured logging with levels
├── utils.ts            — shared helpers
├── scanner.ts          — discovers tokens with active lending
├── wallet-profiler.ts  — SAID reputation + trade history analysis
├── risk-scorer.ts      — 4-factor weighted risk scoring
├── liquidator.ts       — executes liquidation transactions
├── monitor.ts          — main orchestration (scan + score loops)
└── index.ts            — entry point with mode routing
```

Each file handles a single responsibility. The bot runs two concurrent loops:
- **Scan loop** (default: every 60s) -- discovers tokens with active lending, snapshots prices
- **Score loop** (default: every 15s) -- profiles borrowers, scores loans, executes liquidations

## Network & Permissions

- **Default mode (`info`) is read-only** — no wallet needed, no signing, no state changes.
- **Outbound connections:** Solana RPC (via `@solana/web3.js`) and SAID Protocol API (via `torchsdk.verifySaid`). No telemetry or third-party services.
- **Distributed via npm** — all code runs from `node_modules/`. No post-install hooks, no remote code fetching.
- **Transactions are built locally** using the Anchor IDL and signed client-side. The on-chain program validates all parameters.

## Setup

### Install

```bash
npm install torch-liquidation-bot
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RPC_URL` | yes | -- | Solana RPC endpoint |
| `WALLET` | bot/watch only | -- | Solana wallet keypair (base58) |
| `MODE` | no | `info` | `info`, `bot`, or `watch` |
| `MINT` | no (info/watch) | -- | Token mint address for single-token modes |
| `SCAN_INTERVAL_MS` | no | `60000` | How often to discover new lending markets |
| `SCORE_INTERVAL_MS` | no | `15000` | How often to re-score positions |
| `MIN_PROFIT_SOL` | no | `0.01` | Minimum profit in SOL to execute a liquidation |
| `RISK_THRESHOLD` | no | `60` | Minimum risk score (0-100) to flag as high-risk |
| `PRICE_HISTORY` | no | `20` | Number of price snapshots to keep for momentum |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | no | `15000` | Polling interval for watch mode |
| `AUTO_REPAY` | no | `false` | Auto-repay your own position if liquidatable (watch mode) |

### Run

```bash
# show lending info for all migrated tokens (default, no wallet needed)
RPC_URL=<rpc> npx torch-liquidation-bot

# show lending info for a specific token
MODE=info MINT=<mint> RPC_URL=<rpc> npx torch-liquidation-bot

# run the liquidation bot (requires wallet)
MODE=bot WALLET=<key> RPC_URL=<rpc> npx torch-liquidation-bot

# watch your own loan health (requires wallet)
MODE=watch MINT=<mint> WALLET=<key> RPC_URL=<rpc> npx torch-liquidation-bot
```

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { Monitor, loadConfig } from 'torch-liquidation-bot'
import { Connection } from '@solana/web3.js'

const config = loadConfig()
const connection = new Connection(config.rpcUrl, 'confirmed')
const monitor = new Monitor(connection, config)
await monitor.start()
```
