# 🎯 4To1 Planner — AI Planning Coach

> **From Vision to Action: 4to1**

An OpenClaw Skill that transforms your AI agent into a personal planning coach using the **4To1 Method™**.

## The Problem

Most planners stop at 90 days. To-do apps manage tasks but not direction. You end up busy but not strategic — disconnected from what actually matters.

## The 4To1 Method™

A 4-layer system that bridges the gap between your biggest dreams and today's to-do list:

```
🔭 4 YEARS  →  Strategic Vision        (Where am I going?)
📊 3 MONTHS →  Project Milestones      (Quarterly Gantt Log)
🏃 2 WEEKS  →  Action Execution        (1 Day in a Week sprints)
✅ 1 DAY    →  Daily Tasks             (What am I doing RIGHT NOW?)

🚫 Not-To-Do List   →  What I'm saying NO to
⏰ Time Wasters      →  Habits I'm eliminating
```

**Every daily task connects up.** Nothing floats.

## Why AI-Native?

Old way: Download a template. Fill it out once. Forget about it.

4To1 AI way:
- **Conversational setup** — define your 4-year vision through dialogue, not blank pages
- **Automatic tracking** — AI reads your Notion/Todoist and knows where you stand
- **Proactive coaching** — weekly reviews, stall detection, Not-To-Do enforcement
- **Zero context switching** — plan, review, and adjust all through chat

## What It Does

| Say This | What Happens |
|----------|-------------|
| "Set up my planning system" | Guided onboarding: connect tools, define vision, set milestones |
| "Do my weekly review" | 5-min coached review: check progress, plan next week |
| "What should I focus on today?" | Daily priorities based on your current 2-week sprint |
| "How am I doing?" | Progress snapshot across all 4 layers |
| "Quarterly review" | Deep retrospective + next quarter planning |
| "Add [task] to my plan" | Quick-add with automatic layer linking |

## Supported Backends

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Notion** | Rich databases, Gantt views, visual dashboards |
| **Todoist** | Task-focused, great mobile app |
| **Google Calendar** | Time-block planning |
| **Local Markdown** | Privacy, offline, no account needed |

## Install

```bash
clawhub install 4to1-planner
```

Then tell your OpenClaw agent:
> "Help me set up my 4to1 planning system"

## Competitive Position
