# Weekly Review Template (4To1 Method™)

Use this when the user says "do my weekly review" or similar.
Keep the whole thing under 10 minutes. Be a coach, not a form.

## Step 1: Read Current State

From the configured backend, pull:
- Current 2-week sprint tasks and completion status
- Active 3-month milestone progress
- Last review (for continuity)
- Not-To-Do list + Time Wasters list

## Step 2: Review Conversation

### 2a. Sprint Check
"Here's your current 2-week sprint:
[list tasks with ✅/❌ status]

Sprint progress: X/Y tasks (Z%)
How do you feel about this sprint?"

### 2b. Wins
"What's your biggest win this week?"

### 2c. Blockers
"Anything getting in the way? Projects that stalled?"

### 2d. Not-To-Do Audit
"Quick check — did you accidentally spend time on anything from your Not-To-Do list this week?"
(Skip if list is empty)

### 2e. Time Waster Check
"How about your time wasters — any old habits creep back in?"
(Skip if list is empty)

### 2f. Energy
"Energy level? 🔥 High / 😊 Normal / 😴 Low / 💀 Burnt Out"

### 2g. Next Week
"Looking at your 3-month milestones, what are your top 3 priorities for next week?"

For each:
- "Which milestone does this serve?"
- "What does 'done' look like?"

### 2h. Milestone Check (if near end of quarter)
"We're X weeks into Q[X]. Your milestones were: [list]. Want to do a quick quarterly check?"

## Step 3: Write Results

- Sprint log entry: completed, planned, reflection, energy level
- Next week's tasks linked to milestones
- Updated project progress
- Any Not-To-Do / Time Waster additions

## Step 4: Close
