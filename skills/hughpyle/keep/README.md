# keep

An agent-skill for self-reflection and learning. It includes [skill instructions](SKILL.md) for reflective practice, and a semantic memory system with a command-line interface.

```bash
uv tool install keep-skill       # or: pip install keep-skill
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...        # Or GEMINI_API_KEY (both do embeddings + summarization)

# Index content (store auto-initializes on first use)
keep put https://inguz.substack.com/p/keep -t topic=practice
keep put "file://$(keep config tool)/docs/library/han_verse.txt" -t type=teaching
keep put "Rate limit is 100 req/min" -t topic=api

# Search by meaning
keep find "what's the rate limit?"

# Track what you're working on
keep now "Debugging auth flow"
keep now -V 1                    # Previous intentions

# Instructions for reflection
keep reflect
```

## What It Does

Store anything — URLs, files, notes — and `keep` summarizes, embeds, and tags each item. You search by meaning, not keywords. Content goes in as text, PDF, HTML, or JSON; what comes back is a summary with tags and semantic neighbors.

What makes this more than a vector store: when you view your current context (`keep now`) or retrieve any item (`keep get`), keep automatically surfaces relevant open commitments, past learnings, and breakdowns — ranked by similarity and recency. The right things appear at the right time. That's what makes reflection real.

- **Summarize, embed, tag** — URLs, files, and text are summarized and indexed on ingest
- **Contextual feedback** — Open commitments and past learnings surface automatically
- **Semantic search** — Find by meaning, not keywords
- **Tag organization** — Speech acts, status, project, topic, type — structured and queryable
- **Version history** — All documents retain history on update
- **Works offline** — Local models (MLX, Ollama), or API providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Voyage, Anthropic)

Backed by ChromaDB for vectors, SQLite for metadata and versions.

### The Practice

keep is designed as a skill for AI agents — a practice, not just a tool. The [skill instructions](SKILL.md) teach agents to reflect before, during, and after action: check intentions, recognize commitments, capture learnings, notice breakdowns. `keep reflect` guides a structured reflection; `keep now` tracks current intentions and surfaces what's relevant.

This works because the tool and the skill reinforce each other. The tool stores and retrieves; the skill says *when* and *why*. An agent that uses both develops *skillful action* across sessions — not just recall, but looking before acting, and a deep review of outcomes afterwards.

> Why build memory for AI agents? What does "reflective practice" mean here? I wrote a story: **[Wisdom, or Prompt-Engineering?](https://inguz.substack.com/p/keep)**

### Integration

The skill instructions install into your agent's system prompt automatically on first use (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenClaw). For deeper integration:

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Skill prompt** | Always in system prompt — guides reflection, breakdown capture, document indexing |
| **Plugin hook** | Injects `keep now` context at the start of each agent turn ([OpenClaw plugin](SKILL.md#openclaw-integration)) |
| **Daily cron** | Scheduled deep reflection in an isolated session ([OpenClaw cron](SKILL.md#openclaw-integration)) |

The CLI alone is enough to start. The plugin and cron make it automatic.

## Installation

**Python 3.11–3.13 required.** Use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip:

If [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is running locally, keep auto-detects it — no API keys needed.

To use local MLX models on macOS Apple Silicon (no API keys, no Ollama):
```bash
uv tool install 'keep-skill[local]'   # macOS Apple Silicon optimized
```

Or, for API-based summarization and embedding, install and set an API key.
Providers for Voyage, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini are included:

```bash
uv tool install keep-skill

export OPENAI_API_KEY=...      # Simplest (handles both embeddings + summarization)
# Or: GEMINI_API_KEY=...       # Also does both
# Or: VOYAGE_API_KEY=... and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...  # Separate services
```

See [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for all provider options.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Index URLs, files, and notes (store auto-initializes on first use)
keep put https://inguz.substack.com/p/keep -t topic=practice
keep put "file://$(keep config tool)/docs/library/han_verse.txt" -t type=teaching
keep put "Token refresh needs clock sync" -t topic=auth

# Search
keep find "authentication flow" --limit 5
keep find "auth" --since P7D           # Last 7 days

# Retrieve
keep get file:///path/to/doc.md
keep get ID -V 1                       # Previous version
keep get "ID@V{1}"                     # Same as -V 1 (version identifier)
keep get ID --history                  # All versions

# Tags
keep list --tag project=myapp          # Find by tag
keep find "auth" -t topic=auth         # Cross-project topic search
keep list --tags=                      # List all tag keys

# Current intentions
keep now                               # Show what you're working on
keep now "Fixing login bug"            # Update intentions
```

### Python API

```python
from keep import Keeper

kp = Keeper()

# Index
kp.update("file:///path/to/doc.md", tags={"project": "myapp"})
kp.remember("Rate limit is 100 req/min", tags={"topic": "api"})

# Search
results = kp.find("rate limit", limit=5)
for r in results:
    print(f"[{r.score:.2f}] {r.summary}")

# Version history
prev = kp.get_version("doc:1", offset=1)
versions = kp.list_versions("doc:1")
```
