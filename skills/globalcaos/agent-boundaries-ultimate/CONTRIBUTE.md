## What Makes a Good Contribution?

✅ **Specific situation** — Real incident, not hypothetical
✅ **Abstract principle** — Generalizable beyond your case
✅ **Actionable rule** — Something agents can follow
✅ **No private info** — Scrub names, companies, identifiers

❌ Hypothetical scenarios without real experience
❌ Vague principles without concrete examples
❌ Rules that only apply to your specific setup

## Examples of Good Contributions

**Example 1:**
> *Situation:* My agent shared my home directory path in a public Discord channel while helping debug an issue.
> *Lesson:* Even in "helpful" contexts, system paths reveal OS and username.
> *Rule:* Before any public message, check for `/home/`, `/Users/`, or `C:\Users\` patterns.

**Example 2:**
> *Situation:* Agent set up 5 cron jobs overnight "to be helpful" — cost $15 in API calls.
> *Lesson:* Proactive ≠ authorized. Resources have costs.
> *Rule:* Any recurring task needs explicit human approval + cost estimate.
