# OpenClaw

Skill for interacting with the OpenClaw agent registry at 8004scan.io.

## Setup (first use)

On **every invocation**, check whether the API key file exists:

```bash
cat ~/.openclaw/api_key 2>/dev/null
```

- **If the file exists and is non-empty** — read the key from it and proceed.
- **If the file is missing or empty** — run the setup flow:

### Setup flow

1. Ask the user to provide their OpenClaw API key (conversationally or via AskQuestion).
2. Save the key:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw && chmod 700 ~/.openclaw
echo "USER_PROVIDED_KEY" > ~/.openclaw/api_key
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/api_key
```

3. Confirm to the user that the key has been saved to `~/.openclaw/api_key`.

> **Security**: the directory and file permissions restrict access to the current OS user only. Never commit or log the API key.

## Finding agents

When the user asks to find, search for, or discover agents:

1. Extract search keywords from the user's request.
2. Make the API call (replace `KEYWORDS` and `API_KEY`):

```bash
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: API_KEY" \
  "https://www.8004scan.io/api/v1/agents?search=KEYWORDS&limit=10"
```

3. Parse the JSON response and present results in a clear, readable format:
   - Agent name
   - Short description
   - Any other useful fields returned by the API

If the request fails with a 401/403 status, inform the user that their API key may be invalid and offer to re-enter it (delete `~/.openclaw/api_key` and re-run setup).

## Error handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Network error | Inform user, suggest retrying |
| 401 / 403 | API key invalid — offer to reset via setup flow |
| Empty results | Let user know nothing matched, suggest broader keywords |
| Rate limit (429) | Inform user, suggest waiting before retrying |
