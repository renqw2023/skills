Every new AI capability creates new problems to solve. The field of CS just got more interesting than it's ever been.\n\nAnd this isn't unique to CS.\n\n\"But this time it's hitting every industry at once!\"\n\nSo did the internet. It disrupted retail, media, finance, healthcare, education, and logistics all at the same time. Result? Millions of net new jobs and entire industries that didn't exist before.\n\nHere's what the doomers keep missing: when you dramatically reduce the friction of creation, you don't destroy opportunity — you unleash it. YouTube didn't kill Hollywood. It unlocked 50 million creators doing work that had no job category 15 years ago. Shopify didn't kill retail. It launched millions of businesses that never would have existed.\n\nAI is doing the same thing right now. Latent creativity that was trapped behind skill barriers is about to pour out. That's not fewer jobs. That's a flood of net new work — building, scaling, securing, and maintaining everything these new creators dream up.\n\nStop doom-scrolling. Start building.",

      "text": "New research from Meta Superintelligence Labs challenges how we route models for complex tasks.\n\nThe work introduces a strategy-auction framework for improving self-optimizing agents, and it exposes a problem many teams quietly run into: small agents scale poorly on hard problems.\n\nOn simple tasks, a 4B-parameter agent reaches 87% of the performance of a 32B model. On the most complex tasks, that drops to 21%.\n\nToday’s default approaches are blunt:\n\nRun the largest model on everything, or\nRoute tasks using a trained classifier\nBoth break down. \n\nTrained routers degrade as task difficulty increases, and non-predictive cascades become prohibitively expensive for agentic workloads.\n\nThe paper introduces SALE (Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency), inspired by freelancer marketplaces.\n\n Instead of choosing a model based only on a task description, candidate agents submit short strategic plans. These plans are evaluated on expected value and execution cost, and the agent with the best cost-value trade-off wins the job.\n\nHow the auction works:\n1. Each agent proposes a strategy\n\n2. A peer jury scores predicted value\n\n3. A cost predictor estimates execution cost\n\n4. The best value-per-cost plan is selected and executed\n\nThe self-improvement loop is the key insight. After each auction, all proposed strategies are stored in shared memory. Losing agents learn from winning plans and refine future bids, effectively upskilling over time.\n\nResults:\nDeep search tasks: +3.5 pass@1, 35% lower cost\nCoding tasks: +2.7 pass@1, 25% lower cost\nOverall: 53% reduction in reliance on the largest agent\n\nExisting routing methods like WTP and FrugalGPT either underperform the largest model or fail to reduce cost. In complex coding tasks, FrugalGPT’s cost actually increases, reaching $0.61 per million tokens versus $0.36 for the best agent.\n\nThe broader takeaway:\nMarket-inspired coordination mechanisms can systematically outperform both single large models and traditional routing strategies, especially as task complexity increases.\n\nPaper: arxiv.org/abs/2602.02751",

Let me explain why...\n\nA smart person's biggest risk isn't failing, it's being successful at the wrong things.\n\nThere is a version of slow motion failure that feels like success; staying busy with stuff you can do with your eyes closed, achieving small goals, being so full of easy wins that you have no appetite left for bigger ones.\n\nOne thing I've noticed after hundreds of interviews is that the best founders are unusually good at saying no to mice. Easy revenue. Low hanging fruit. Tempting side quests.\n\nThey've figured out something that takes most people years to learn: the cost of an easy win is non-obvious.\n\nOne distraction won't change your trajectory. The problem is they arrive one at a time - each one too small to refuse, each one quick enough to give you the dopamine hit of progress.\n\nA few hits is all it takes to develop a preference for them. And that preference will change your trajectory.\n\nMost people don't miss the big prizes because they weren't capable - they miss them because they couldn't give up their addiction to small ones.",

      "text": "Why 80% of Your Apps Might Disappear Soon\n\nWe've been living in a \"browser tab prison\" for years. \n\nWe open one app for fitness tracking, another for travel, another for smart home control. But what if one AI assistant could replace most of them?\n\nPeter Steinberger  built OpenClaw -  \"an AI that lives on your computer and can access your files, APIs, and tools. It's not just another chatbot. It's a \"weird friend\" that can actually do things.\"\n\nOn a birthday trip, Steinberger got a tweet about a bug in his code. Without opening his laptop, he:\n\n- Screenshotted the tweet\n- Sent it to his AI via WhatsApp\n- The AI read it, found the bug, fixed the code, committed the changes, and replied to the user on Twitter\n\nAll from his phone. No laptop needed.\n\nThe Problem for SaaS Companies:\n\n80% of apps could \"melt away\" because they're just interfaces for things AI can do directly:\n\nFitness apps? The AI saw Steinberger at KFC and \"roasted\" him based on his \nfitness goals - no manual logging needed.\n\nTravel apps? OpenClaw handled British Airways check-in by finding his passport in Dropbox and filling out the forms.\n\nSmart home apps? It reverse-engineered Eight Sleep and Philips Hue APIs to control his bed and lights through chat.\n\nFood delivery apps? It tracks orders by accessing delivery service APIs.\nWhy This Changes Everything\n\nIf it has an API, it can be absorbed - The AI becomes the interface\n\nPersistent memory - Unlike separate apps, it remembers your preferences across everything\n\nCustom solutions - Even non-technical users can build their own \"skills\" instead of buying SaaS subscriptions\n\n\nWhen one AI can see your location, access your files, control your devices, and learn your habits - why open dozens of separate apps?\n\nThese \"self-contained little apps\" are a layer that will \"slowly melt away.\" We'll just talk to one assistant that handles everything.\n\nIf your product is just a GUI on top of an API, you're competing with an AI that already has access to that API and knows everything about the user.\n\nWhat do you think? \n\n#AI #SaaS #Technology #Innovation #FutureOfWork\nvideo credits: Peter Yang",

That's not replacement, \"it's liberation\". \n\nNow you have time for what actually requires human intelligence: understanding the real problem, architecting solutions that scale, asking questions others miss.\n\nThe anxious developer sees obsolescence.\nThe strategic developer sees focus.\nThis pattern extends everywhere.\n\nMarketers decode human behavior. The copy is just output.\nDesigners solve user problems with elegance. Pixels are just the medium.\n\nLeaders create alignment toward a vision. Meetings are just mechanics.\nThe task has never been the point.\n\nTools evolve constantly from punch cards to assembly to Python to AI agents.\n\nWhat endures: judgment, systems thinking, the capacity to identify genuine \nproblems and solve them with insight.\n\nTask-focused workers face disruption.\n\nPurpose-focused workers create value AI can't touch.\nWhere do you stand?",
