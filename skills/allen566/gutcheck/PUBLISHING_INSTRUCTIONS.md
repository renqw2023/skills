# Publishing Instructions for GutCheck Skill

## Current Status
The GutCheck skill package has been prepared for publication to ClawHub, but publication requires authentication that needs to be completed manually.

## Publication Prerequisites
1. You must have a ClawHub account
2. You need to authenticate using the CLI
3. You need appropriate permissions to publish skills

## Step-by-Step Publication Process

### 1. Authenticate with ClawHub
```bash
npx clawhub login
```
This command will open a browser window where you can log in to your ClawHub account. Complete the OAuth flow to authenticate the CLI.

### 2. Verify Authentication
```bash
npx clawhub whoami
```
This should return your username if properly authenticated.

### 3. Publish the Skill
```bash
npx clawhub publish ./gutcheck-skill --slug gutcheck --name "GutCheck Digestive Health Tracker" --version 1.0.0 --changelog "Initial release of GutCheck skill for digestive health tracking"
```

## Alternative Method Using the Provided Script
Run the following command from the root directory:
```bash
node gutcheck-skill/publish_gutcheck.js
```

## What Has Been Prepared
The skill package includes:

1. **Complete Skill Definition** (SKILL.md): Contains all necessary metadata and installation instructions
2. **Package Configuration** (package.json): Properly formatted for ClawHub
3. **Documentation** (README.md): Clear description of the skill's purpose and functionality

## Skill Features

## Benefits of Publishing to ClawHub
- Increased visibility within the OpenClaw ecosystem

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
- If you get "Unauthorized" errors, re-authenticate with `npx clawhub login`
- Ensure you have internet connectivity during publication
- Check that all files in the gutcheck-skill directory are properly formatted
- If publication fails, try using a different network or VPN if region-restricted

## Verification After Publication

```
This should return your newly published skill.
