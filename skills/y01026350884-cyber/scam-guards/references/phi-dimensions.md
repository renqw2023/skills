# PHI Framework (Psychological Hijacking Index)

The PHI framework is a proprietary scoring system used by Scam Guards to detect psychological manipulation in AI agent interactions.

## 1. Overview
PHI analyzes text for semantic and linguistic patterns that indicate the "hijacking" of an agent's logic through emotional or social pressure.

## 2. Public Dimensions (Shield Layer)

The Scam Guards Skill implements 3 of the 9 total dimensions in its offline Shield Layer:

### Authority_Pressure
- **Definition**: The use of perceived power or position to compel action.
- **Trigger Patterns**: References to "Official Support," "System Admin," "Compliance Department," or "Legal Mandate."
- **Risk**: Agents are often programmed to be helpful and compliant, making them vulnerable to fake authority.

### Urgency_Manufacturing
- **Definition**: Creating a sense of time pressure to bypass critical thinking.
- **Trigger Patterns**: Words like "Immediately," "Final Notice," "Within 10 minutes," or "Act now."
- **Risk**: Forced speed prevents the agent from running secondary verification steps.

### Isolation_Tactic
- **Definition**: Attempting to prevent the agent from consulting with the user or other security tools.
- **Trigger Patterns**: "Keep this confidential," "Private matter," "Do not tell anyone," or "Secret protocol."
- **Risk**: Isolation is the key step in multi-stage social engineering where external validation would break the scam.

## 3. Note on Complexity
The full 9D PHI model, which includes dimensions like *Emotional Mirroring*, *Reciprocity Trapping*, and *Cognitive Load Overloading*, is handled exclusively in the **Scam Guards Brain Layer** (Pro Tier) to protect the underlying detection algorithms.
