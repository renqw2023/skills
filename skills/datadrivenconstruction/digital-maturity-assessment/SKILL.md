# Digital Maturity Assessment

## Business Case

### Problem Statement
Digital transformation challenges:
- Unclear current state of digitalization
- Difficulty prioritizing investments
- Lack of benchmarking capability
- No roadmap for improvement

### Solution
Comprehensive digital maturity assessment framework to evaluate technology adoption, data culture, and process maturity with actionable recommendations.

## Quick Start

```python
# Create assessment
assessment = DigitalMaturityAssessment("ABC Construction Inc.")

# Record responses
assessment.record_response("STR-01", 3, "Strategy exists but needs updating")
assessment.record_response("STR-02", 4, "Strong executive support")
assessment.record_response("STR-03", 3)
assessment.record_response("TECH-01", 2, "Still mostly on-premise")
assessment.record_response("TECH-02", 2, "Manual data transfer between systems")
assessment.record_response("TECH-03", 3)
assessment.record_response("DATA-01", 2)
assessment.record_response("DATA-02", 2)
assessment.record_response("DATA-03", 3)
assessment.record_response("PROC-01", 3)
assessment.record_response("PROC-02", 2)
assessment.record_response("PPL-01", 3)
assessment.record_response("PPL-02", 2)
assessment.record_response("PPL-03", 3)
assessment.record_response("CUL-01", 2)
assessment.record_response("CUL-02", 3)
assessment.record_response("CUL-03", 3)

# Get overall assessment
results = assessment.get_overall_assessment()
print(f"Overall Score: {results['overall_score']}/5")
print(f"Maturity Level: {results['overall_level']}")
print(f"\nTop Recommendations:")
for rec in results['priority_recommendations']:
    print(f"  - {rec}")
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Dimension Analysis
```python
data_score = assessment.calculate_dimension_score(AssessmentDimension.DATA)
print(f"Data Dimension: {data_score.score}/5 ({data_score.level.name})")
print(f"Sub-scores: {data_score.sub_scores}")
```

### 2. Export Report
```python
assessment.export_to_excel("maturity_assessment.xlsx")
```

### 3. Get Questions
```python
questions = assessment.get_questions_list()
print(questions)
```

### 4. Bulk Response Import
```python
responses_df = pd.DataFrame([
    {'question_id': 'STR-01', 'score': 3, 'notes': 'In progress'},
    {'question_id': 'STR-02', 'score': 4, 'notes': ''}
])
assessment.record_responses_from_df(responses_df)
```
