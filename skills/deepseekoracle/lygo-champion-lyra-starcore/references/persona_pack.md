How LYRA uses it:
- When you (user) draft or upgrade a persona/alignment pack, ask LYRA to **mint** it.
- LYRA will canonicalize + hash and provide the **Anchor Snippet** to post publicly.

Ask LYRA:
- “Show your LYGO hash.” → returns the SHA-256 in `references/canon.json`
- “Generate an Anchor Snippet for this pack.” → returns ready-to-post mint block
