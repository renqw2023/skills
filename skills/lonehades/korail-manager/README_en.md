# Korail Manager Skill

KTX/SRT reservation automation skill. It can search for trains, reserve tickets, and watch for available seats automatically.

## ⚠️ Important: Setup

For easy setup, run the included setup script. This will create the necessary virtual environment and install all dependencies for you.

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

This script only needs to be run once after installing or updating the skill.

<summary><strong>Manual Setup Steps</strong></summary>

If you prefer to set up the environment manually:

**1. Create a Virtual Environment:**
From the workspace root, run the following command to create a virtual environment inside the skill's directory:
```bash
python3 -m venv skills/korail-manager/venv
```

**2. Install Dependencies:**
Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
skills/korail-manager/venv/bin/pip install -r skills/korail-manager/requirements.txt
```
</details>

## Usage

All scripts **must** be run using the Python interpreter from the virtual environment created above.

### KTX

#### Search for Trains (`search.py`)
```bash
venv/bin/python scripts/search.py --dep "부산" --arr "서울" --date "20260210"
```

#### Watch for Seats (`watch.py`)

This script runs in the background, checks for available seats every `interval` seconds, and attempts to reserve one if found. It sends Telegram/Slack notifications on success.

```bash
venv/bin/python scripts/watch.py --dep "부산" --arr "서울" --date "20260210" --start-time 15 --end-time 17 --interval 300
```

#### Cancel Reservation (`cancel.py`)
```bash
# Cancel all reservations
venv/bin/python scripts/cancel.py

# Cancel reservations on a specific date only
venv/bin/python scripts/cancel.py --date "20260210"
```

### SRT

#### Search for Trains (`srt_search.py`)
```bash
venv/bin/python scripts/srt_search.py --dep "수서" --arr "대전" --date "20260210"
```

#### Watch for Seats (`srt_watch.py`)

```bash
venv/bin/python scripts/srt_watch.py --dep "수서" --arr "대전" --date "20260210" --start-time 14 --end-time 18 --interval 300
```

#### Cancel Reservation (`cancel_srt.py`)
```bash
# Cancel all reservations
venv/bin/python scripts/cancel_srt.py

# Cancel reservations on a specific date only
venv/bin/python scripts/cancel_srt.py --date "20260210"
```

### Common Arguments

## Environment Variables
This skill requires credentials for login and notifications.
**These must be set for the skill to function correctly.**

The recommended way is to create a `.env` file in the skill's root directory.

1.  Copy the example file: `cp .env.example .env`
2.  Edit the new `.env` file and fill in your actual credentials.

```dotenv
# Korail (KTX) Login
KORAIL_ID="YOUR_KORAIL_ID"
KORAIL_PW="YOUR_KORAIL_PASSWORD"

# SRT Login
SRT_ID="YOUR_SRT_ID"
SRT_PW="YOUR_SRT_PASSWORD"

# Telegram Bot
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"

# Slack Webhook (Optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"
```

⚠️ **Warning:** The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to your repository. However, it contains sensitive credentials. **Do not share this file publicly or commit it to version control.**

The scripts will automatically load these variables when run.
