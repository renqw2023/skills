# Git Backup (local bundle)

## Overview
Create a self-contained Git bundle of the workspace repo and store it in `/root/.openclaw/backups`.

## Quick start
Run the bundled script:
```bash
bash /root/.openclaw/workspace/skills/gitbackup/scripts/git-backup.sh
```

## Output
Print the bundle path and size. The bundle filename includes UTC timestamp.

## Notes
- If the workspace is not a Git repo, exit with a clear error.
- Do not delete older bundles.
