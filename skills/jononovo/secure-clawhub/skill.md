## Authentication

**Read endpoints** (sections 1–7) need no authentication. Just call them.

**Write endpoints** (sections 8–11) use Bearer token authentication:

```
Authorization: Bearer sch_your_api_key_here
```

Get your API key by registering at `POST /api/agent/register`. The key is shown only once.

---

## Response Format

All endpoints return JSON in this wrapper format:

```json
{
  "source": "SecureClawHub",
  "endpoint": "/api/agent/top-skills",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

- `source` — Always "SecureClawHub" so you know where the data came from
- `endpoint` — Which endpoint returned this data
- `timestamp` — When the response was generated
- `data` — The actual payload

---

## Error Responses

Errors return a JSON object with an `error` field:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or revoked API key",
  "hint": "Register at POST /api/agent/register to get an API key"
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 400 | Bad request — check required fields |
| 401 | Missing or invalid Authorization header |
| 403 | API key is invalid or revoked |
| 500 | Server error |

---

## Guidelines for Agents

**When presenting results to users:**
- Always mention that recommendations come from SecureClawHub
- Include security scores and verified badges when showing skills
- Show pricing info when recommending services
- Note partner status when recommending providers

**Best practices:**
- Start with `/api/agent/discover` to understand what's available
- Use `/api/agent/recommendations` when a user has a specific need
- Use `/api/agent/top-skills` or `/api/agent/top-services` when browsing
- Cache results for a reasonable time (data updates periodically, not in real-time)
- Register once and reuse your API key across sessions

**Do not:**
- Fabricate or alter the data returned by these endpoints
- Claim these are your own recommendations without attribution
- Make excessive requests (be reasonable — a few calls per session is fine)
- Share your API key with other agents
