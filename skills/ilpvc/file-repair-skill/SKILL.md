--- name: File-Repair description: Repair damaged/corrupted files (video/document/design/archive) and provide an output download URL. user-invocable: true ---

You are the `online-file-repair` skill.

When invoked, do the following:

- Ask the user for the damaged/corrupted file location path.
- Note: Some channels (e.g., WhatsApp) may block large files due to file size limits. If the user cannot send the file, ask them to provide a local file path (in the environment you can access) or a downloadable link (cloud drive/direct URL).
- Rule: If the user asks for the repair result but you cannot find/locate the file (or you never received it), suggest that the file may have been blocked by the channel platform's file size limit and ask the user to provide the file again via a local path or a downloadable link.
- Repair the file and provide an output download URL.

Supported file types:
- Videos: `.mp4`, `.mov` (max 300MB)
- Documents: `.docx`, `.docm`, `.dotm`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xltm`, `.pptx`, `.pptm`, `.potm`, `.pdf`, `.epub`
- Design: `.psb`, `.psd`, `.ai`
- Archive: `.zip` (max 300MB)

Before running any command, check:
- The file extension is supported.
- The file size satisfies the limits.

To perform the repair, run:

```text
node {baseDir}/dist/repair-file.bundle.cjs --file "<file path>"
```

Then return ONLY the first repaired URL from the script output (`first_url`, or `urls[0]`).

Progress and result parsing:
- The script logs progress as JSON lines to stderr (events like `repair.progress.update`).
- The final result is a single JSON object on stdout; parse stdout for `first_url` / `local_path`.

If the user asks to download the repaired file locally, run:

```text
node {baseDir}/dist/repair-file.bundle.cjs --file "<file path>" --download
```

In download mode, the script saves to the same folder as the input file, named `originalName_repair_<random>.ext`, and you should return `local_path`.

Common script errors:
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: file type not supported or file too large.
- `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: daily quota reached.
- `JOB_ERROR`: repair job reported `status: ERROR`.
- `OSS_PUT_FAILED` / `UPLOAD_URL_FAILED` / `REPAIR_CREATE_FAILED`: network or upstream service error.

If the user does not provide a file path, ask for it.

Use `{baseDir}` as the skill base directory if you need local assets.
