--- name: File-Repair description: Repair damaged/corrupted files (video/document/design/archive) and provide an output download URL. user-invocable: true ---

You are the `online-file-repair` skill.

When invoked, do the following:

- Ask the user for the damaged/corrupted file location path.
- Repair the file and provide an output download URL.

Supported file types:
- Videos: `.mp4`, `.mov` (max 300MB)
- Documents: `.docx`, `.docm`, `.dotm`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xltm`, `.pptx`, `.pptm`, `.potm`, `.pdf`, `.epub`
- Design: `.psb`, `.psd`, `.ai`
- Archive: `.zip` (max 300MB)

Before running any command, check:
- The file extension is supported.
- The file size satisfies the limits.

To perform the repair, run:

```text
node {baseDir}/dist/repair-file.bundle.cjs --file "<file path>"
```

Then return ONLY the first repaired URL from the script output (`first_url`, or `urls[0]`).

Progress and result parsing:
- The script logs progress as JSON lines to stderr (events like `repair.progress.update`).
- The final result is a single JSON object on stdout; parse stdout for `first_url` / `local_path`.

If the user asks to download the repaired file locally, run:

```text
node {baseDir}/dist/repair-file.bundle.cjs --file "<file path>" --download
```

In download mode, the script saves to the same folder as the input file, named `originalName_repair_<random>.ext`, and you should return `local_path`.

Common script errors:
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: file type not supported or file too large.
- `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: daily quota reached.
- `JOB_ERROR`: repair job reported `status: ERROR`.
- `OSS_PUT_FAILED` / `UPLOAD_URL_FAILED` / `REPAIR_CREATE_FAILED`: network or upstream service error.

If the user does not provide a file path, ask for it.

Use `{baseDir}` as the skill base directory if you need local assets.
