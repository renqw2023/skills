>
> 1. **Domain authority** - New domains take 6-12 months; established domains see faster results
> 2. **Competition level** - Low-competition keywords rank in 1-3 months; high-competition may take 12+ months
> 3. **Implementation quality** - Comprehensive optimization accelerates results
> 4. **Existing backlink profile** - Sites with 20+ quality backlinks see 40% faster improvements (Ahrefs study)

> - Meta descriptions
> - Headers
> - Content
> - Links
> - Images

**Problems**:
- No explanations
- No prioritization
- Not actionable
- Missing context

**Citation likelihood**: 2/10

---

### After (Rich List)

> Critical on-page SEO factors ranked by impact:
>
> 1. **Title tags** - Most important on-page element; include primary keyword within first 60 characters. Title tags directly influence both rankings and CTR.
>
> 2. **Content quality and depth** - Comprehensive content (1,500+ words for competitive keywords) outranks thin content. Focus on topical authority over keyword density.
>
> 3. **Header structure (H1-H6)** - Use one H1 with primary keyword, multiple H2s for main sections. Proper hierarchy helps search engines understand content structure.
>
> 4. **Internal linking** - Link to 3-5 related pages using descriptive anchor text. Internal links distribute page authority and help search engines discover content.
>
> 5. **Image optimization** - Compress images to under 100KB, use descriptive alt text with target keywords. Page speed and accessibility both impact rankings.
>
> 6. **URL structure** - Use descriptive, keyword-rich URLs (example.com/keyword-topic) avoiding parameters. Clean URLs improve click-through rates by 25% (Backlinko study).
>
> Optimize these six factors before moving to advanced tactics.

**Improvements**:
- Prioritized ranking
- Specific guidance for each
- Actionable recommendations
- Supporting data
- Clear next step

**Citation likelihood**: 8/10

## Example 8: Trend/Prediction Content

### Before (Speculation)

> AI is going to change SEO a lot in the future. Things will be different and SEO professionals will need to adapt.

### After (Evidence-Based Trend)

> AI is fundamentally transforming SEO search behavior. According to Gartner's 2024 research, AI-powered search will reduce traditional search engine traffic by 25% by 2026, as users increasingly rely on AI chatbots for information.
>
> Three specific shifts SEO professionals must prepare for:
>
> 1. **Zero-click content consumption** - Users get answers without visiting websites, requiring optimization for AI citations rather than clicks
>
> 2. **Conversation-based queries** - Natural language questions replace keyword-based searches, demanding content that answers specific questions
>
> 3. **Source attribution value** - Being cited by AI systems (Generative Engine Optimization/GEO) becomes as important as ranking #1
>
> Forrester predicts that by 2025, 30% of organic traffic will come from AI system citations rather than traditional search results, making GEO optimization critical for visibility.

**Improvements**:
- Specific statistics with sources
- Clear timeframes
- Concrete changes identified
- Multiple research citations

**Problems**:
- Oversimplified without specifics
- No concrete metrics
- Vague improvement guidance
- Missing thresholds

**Citation likelihood**: 2/10

### After (Clear, Specific)

> Core Web Vitals are three specific metrics Google uses to measure page experience:
>
> | Metric | Measures | Good Score | Impact |
> |--------|----------|------------|--------|
> | **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** | Loading performance | <2.5 seconds | How quickly main content appears |
> | **FID (First Input Delay)** | Interactivity | <100 milliseconds | How quickly page responds to user input |
> | **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** | Visual stability | <0.1 | How much content shifts during loading |
>
> According to Google's 2024 documentation, pages meeting all three thresholds rank higher and receive 24% more clicks than pages failing these metrics. Core Web Vitals became an official ranking factor in June 2021 as part of Google's Page Experience update.

2. **Include attribution** - Add sources for all claims
3. **Structure clearly** - Use tables, lists, numbered steps
4. **Quantify everything** - Numbers > adjectives
5. **Make standalone** - Each statement should work in isolation
6. **Add context** - Explain why, not just what
7. **Use precise language** - Eliminate ambiguity
8. **Include timeframes** - When was this measured/true?
9. **Show authority** - Reference experts, studies, data
10. **Enable verification** - Link to sources, cite methodology

---

## Quick Quotability Test

Ask these questions about your content:

1. **Can AI quote this without additional context?** - If no, add context
2. **Does it include specific numbers?** - If no, add data
3. **Is the source clear?** - If no, add attribution
4. **Is language precise and unambiguous?** - If no, clarify
5. **Would an expert approve this?** - If no, add authority signals
6. **Is it scannable?** - If no, add structure
7. **Is it up-to-date?** - If no, update or add date context
8. **Can it be verified?** - If no, add sources
9. **Is it specific to a use case?** - If no, add context
10. **Does it answer a complete question?** - If no, expand

If you answer "yes" to 8+ questions, content is highly quotable.
If you answer "yes" to 5-7 questions, content is moderately quotable.
If you answer "yes" to fewer than 5, content needs significant optimization.
