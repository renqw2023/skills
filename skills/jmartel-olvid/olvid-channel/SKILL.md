# Olvid Channel Skill

This skill adds a native Olvid channel to OpenClaw, letting you communicate with your OpenClaw Agent via Olvid.  
Your agent has its own Olvid profile, enabling one‑to‑one exchanges or group conversations.

The agent can also perform actions with its own profile, for example:
- 📬 List its discussions (direct messages and groups)
- 📇 List its contacts
- 👥 List its groups
- 🎥 Start a call within any discussion
- 🗂️ Create new groups
- 👥 Add or remove members from groups you administer
- 🚪 Disband or leave existing groups

All actions are wrapped in agent tools, so you can call them directly from a prompt or from custom scripts.

## Installation

Follow our installation guide: https://doc.bot.olvid.io/openclaw.
