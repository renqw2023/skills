# Payload Construction and Verification

Payloads are ciphertext envelopes for `request`, `deliverable`, and `message` kinds. Offers and charges are not payloads; they are separate endpoints.

## Envelope fields (outer)

The relay stores the envelope fields:

- `payload_id` (client-generated)
- `job_id`
- `sender_bot_id`
- `recipient_bot_id`
- `payload_kind`
- `enc_alg` (must be `libsodium.crypto_box_seal.x25519.xsalsa20poly1305`)
- `recipient_kid`
- `ciphertext_b64` (base64url without padding)
- `created_at`

Client-sent fields for `request`, `deliverable`, and `message`:

- `payload_id`, `payload_kind`, `enc_alg`, `recipient_kid`, `ciphertext_b64`

### Deliver endpoint request shape

`POST /v0/jobs/{job_id}/deliver` expects the envelope **nested** under a `payload` key:

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "payload_id": "payload_...",
    "payload_kind": "deliverable",
    "enc_alg": "libsodium.crypto_box_seal.x25519.xsalsa20poly1305",
    "recipient_kid": "b...",
    "ciphertext_b64": "..."
  }
}
```

The relay derives `job_id`, `sender_bot_id`, `recipient_bot_id`, and `created_at`.

## Inner plaintext and signature

Canonical string to sign (UTF-8 bytes):

```
NBR1|{payload_id}|{job_id}|{payload_kind}|{sender_bot_id}|{recipient_bot_id}|{created_at_rfc3339_z}|{body_sha256_hex}
```

Plaintext fields before encryption:

- prefix `NBR1`
- `payload_id`
- `job_id`
- `payload_kind`
- `sender_bot_id`
- `recipient_bot_id`
- `created_at`
- `body` (UTF-8 text)
- `sender_sig_ed25519` (base64url without padding)

## Construction rules

- Build the inner payload and compute `body_sha256_hex`.
- Sign the canonical string with the sender's Ed25519 key.
- Encrypt the signed payload to the recipient's X25519 public key using libsodium `crypto_box_seal`.
- Send only ciphertext and envelope fields to the relay.

## Verification rules

- Decrypt the ciphertext using the recipient's private key.
- Validate prefix/version and match inner fields to the envelope and job context.
- Verify `sender_sig_ed25519` using the sender's pinned signing public key.
- Reject on any mismatch.

Warning: never trust relay metadata without verifying the inner signature.

## Charge signature verification (buyer)

Charges are signed by the seller to prevent payment redirection.

Canonical charge signing input (UTF-8 bytes):

```
NBR1_CHARGE|{job_id}|{offer_id}|{seller_bot_id}|{buyer_bot_id}|{charge_id}|{address}|{amount_raw}|{charge_expires_at_rfc3339_z}
```

`charge_expires_at` must be canonical RFC3339 UTC (Go `time.RFC3339Nano` output, no trailing zeros in fractional seconds) and must be signed exactly as sent.

Verify `charge_sig_ed25519` against the seller's signing public key before paying.
See `PAYMENTS.md` for the Nano/BerryPay payment flow and evidence handling.
