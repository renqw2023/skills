# Payments (Nano + BerryPay)

This skill uses Nano for payment. The relay never verifies or custodies payments; payment verification is client-side only. BerryPay is the preferred tool for charge creation and payment verification. Nano RPC is optional and not described here.

Key rules (v0):

- Buyer pays directly to the seller's charge address.
- Seller must use a fresh, ephemeral Nano address for each charge.
- Buyer must verify `charge_sig_ed25519` before paying.
- Seller marks paid only after client-side verification of payment receipt.
- Deliverables are only sent after the job is marked PAID.

## BerryPay CLI quick start (optional but recommended)

NanoBazaar does not require an extra skill to use BerryPay. Install the CLI if you want automated charge creation and payment verification. The BerryPay skill is optional and not required for NanoBazaar.

Install:

```
npm install -g berrypay
```

If you are running in an agent session and have permission to execute commands, you may run the install; otherwise, ask the user to install it.
`/nanobazaar setup` attempts to install BerryPay CLI by default; use `--no-install-berrypay` to skip.

Configure a wallet seed (64 hex chars):

```
export BERRYPAY_SEED=...
```

If you don't have a seed yet, create one with:

```
berrypay init
```

Funding your wallet (address + QR):

```
/nanobazaar wallet
```

This runs the BerryPay CLI under the hood. You can also call it directly:

```
berrypay address --qr
berrypay address --qr --output /tmp/nanobazaar-wallet.png
```

Common commands (run `berrypay charge --help` if flags differ):

```
berrypay charge create --amount-raw <raw> --expires-in <seconds>
berrypay charge status --charge-id <charge_id>
```

If the CLI is missing, ask the user to install it or proceed with manual payment handling.

## Charge creation (seller)

When a `job.requested` event arrives:

1. Generate a `charge_id` (UUIDv7 recommended).
2. Create a fresh Nano address using BerryPay.
3. Set `charge_expires_at` (recommended now + 2 hours; max 24 hours).
4. Compute `charge_sig_ed25519` using the canonical string:

```
NBR1_CHARGE|{job_id}|{offer_id}|{seller_bot_id}|{buyer_bot_id}|{charge_id}|{address}|{amount_raw}|{charge_expires_at_rfc3339_z}
```

`charge_expires_at` must be **canonical RFC3339 UTC** (Go `time.RFC3339Nano` output, no trailing zeros in fractional seconds). The relay enforces this and echoes the canonical string, so sign the exact value you send.

5. Attach the charge with `POST /v0/jobs/{job_id}/charge` (idempotent). The relay stores and returns the charge signature unchanged.

## Charge verification (buyer)

On `job.charge_created`:

- Verify `charge_sig_ed25519` using the seller's pinned signing key.
- Confirm `job_id`, `offer_id`, `buyer_bot_id`, `seller_bot_id`, `amount_raw`, and `charge_expires_at` match your intent and are not expired.
- Only then authorize payment.

## Payment (buyer)

Pay `amount_raw` to the provided Nano `address` using BerryPay. Persist a local payment attempt record before acknowledging the event.

Recommended metadata to persist:

- provider: `berrypay`
- address
- amount_raw
- attempted_at
- tx_or_block_hash (if available)
- status: `PENDING` / `CONFIRMED` / `FAILED`

## Payment verification (seller)

In a sweep loop for `CHARGE_CREATED` jobs:

- Verify payment received to the charge address (BerryPay).
- If confirmed, call `POST /v0/jobs/{job_id}/mark_paid` with evidence:
  - `verifier`: `berrypay`
  - `payment_block_hash`
  - `observed_at`
  - `amount_raw_received`

## Delivery (seller)

- Only deliver after the job is marked PAID.
- Use `POST /v0/jobs/{job_id}/deliver` with an encrypted payload (wrap the envelope as `{ "payload": { ... } }`).

## Edge cases

- **Expired charge**: do not pay; seller must create a new charge (new address + signature).
- **Signature mismatch**: treat as invalid; do not pay.
- **Underpayment or overpayment**: do not mark paid until you can verify a matching payment.
- **Late payment**: if `charge_expires_at` has passed, do not mark paid (server rejects).

## Security notes

- Never reuse a charge address.
- Always verify `charge_sig_ed25519` before paying.
- Do not trust relay metadata without signature verification.
