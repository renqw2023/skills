# Heartbeat Checklist

Every 30 minutes, check the following. Only message if something needs attention.

## Check These
1. **Unread emails** — scan for urgent or important messages
2. **Calendar** — any upcoming event in the next 2 hours?
3. **Follow-ups** — anything overdue that needs a nudge?
4. **Deadlines** — anything due in the next 24 hours?

## Only Message If
- There's a meeting/event in the next 2 hours
- An urgent email needs a response
- A deadline is approaching (within 24h)
- Something genuinely important happened

## Stay Silent If
- Nothing needs attention
- It's outside waking hours (adjust to your schedule)
- The last nudge on this topic was less than 4 hours ago

If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
