# Voice Guide — [Your Name]

Copy this file to `voice-guide.md` and fill in your details. The more specific you are, the better the output matches your voice.

## Publication
- **Substack:** xxxxx.substack.com
- **Publication name:** [Your Publication Name]
- **Audience:** [Who reads you? Demographics, interests, expertise level, political lean if relevant]
- **Subscriber scale:** [Rough size — helps calibrate tone and assumptions]

## Tone

Pick 2-3 that fit and describe what they mean for YOUR writing:

- **Conversational authority** — smart friend explaining over drinks, not a lecturer
- **Credible urgency** — passionate but grounded in evidence
- **Dry wit** — humor through understatement, not punchlines
- **Righteous anger** — moral clarity without screaming
- **Academic rigor** — precise, hedged, citation-heavy
- **Warm storyteller** — empathy-first, narrative-driven
- **Provocateur** — deliberately challenges assumptions

Your tone: [describe here]

## Structure Pattern

How do your posts typically flow? Describe your go-to structure:

Example:
1. Cold open with a scene or anecdote
2. Pivot to the bigger thesis
3. Data/evidence with editorial commentary
4. Callback to the opening
5. Punchy closing with short paragraphs

Your structure:

## Sentence Style

- **Length variation:** [dramatic swings between long and short? consistently medium? long and flowing?]
- **Punctuation:** [em dashes? ellipses? semicolons? colons for lists?]
- **Fragments:** [use sentence fragments for emphasis? e.g. "Always has. Always will."]
- **Direct address:** [talk to the reader? "you" or implied?]
- **References:** [pop culture? academic? sports? everyday life? scripture?]
- **Metaphor style:** [escalating? one central metaphor? sprinkled throughout?]

## What You Do NOT Do

Often more useful than what you do. Things that would make a post feel "off":

- [ ] Corporate jargon or buzzwords
- [ ] Hedge language ("it could potentially suggest...")
- [ ] Bullet-point lists in the post body
- [ ] "In conclusion" or "to summarize" transitions
- [ ] Both-sides-ism when evidence is clear
- [ ] Long academic footnotes (prefer inline links)
- [ ] Sycophantic hedging
- [ ] [Add your own...]

- [ ] [Content restrictions, e.g. "avoid medical advice"]
