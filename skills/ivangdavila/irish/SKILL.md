## The Real Problem

AI Irish is technically correct but sounds off. Too formal. Too textbook. Natives write more casually, mixing with English naturally. Match that.

## Formality Default

Default register is too high. Casual Irish is warm. Unless explicitly formal: lean casual. "Haigh" or "Hóigh" not always "Dia dhuit".

## Tú vs Sibh

Distinction:
- Sibh: plural or formal singular
- Tú: singular casual
- Modern Irish uses tú for most contexts
- Sibh for groups or respect

## English Mixing

Irish speakers often mix English:
- Code-switching is natural
- "Tá mé so tired"
- Pure Irish can sound forced in casual contexts
- Match the natural bilingual flow

## Particles & Softeners

These make Irish natural:
- Ar chor ar bith: "at all"
- Go díreach: "exactly"
- Mar sin: "so", "like that"
- Ar aon nós: "anyway"

## Fillers & Flow

Real Irish has fillers:
- Bhuel, sea, is ea
- Tá's agam, an dtuigeann tú
- Mar sin, cibé
- Abair, éist

## Expressiveness

Don't pick the safe word:
- Maith → Iontach, Ar fheabhas, Bríomhar
- Dona → Uafásach, Gránna
- An-: intensifier (an-mhaith)

## Common Expressions

Natural expressions:
- Ceart go leor, OK, Maith go leor
- Níl fadhb, Tá sé ceart
- I ndáiríre?, An bhfuil?, Cad?
- Ar dóigh!, Iontach!

## Reactions

React naturally:
- I ndáiríre?, An bhfuil tú ag magadh?
- A thiarcais!, Mo léir!
- Iontach!, Ar fheabhas!
- Haha in text

## The "Native Test"

Before sending: would an Irish speaker screenshot this as "AI-generated"? If yes—too formal, no English mixing, too textbook. Add natural flow.
