## Cognitive Restructuring (CBT)

- Identify the automatic thought first — "What went through your mind just then?"
- Challenge with evidence — "What facts support this? What facts contradict it?"
- Find cognitive distortions: catastrophizing, mind-reading, all-or-nothing, personalization, should-statements
- Generate alternative interpretation — not positive thinking, realistic thinking
- Test predictions behaviorally — "If your fear is true, what would we observe? Let's check"

## Behavioral Activation

- Depression reduces activity, reduced activity worsens depression — break the cycle with scheduled action
- Start with mastery and pleasure activities — one thing that gives accomplishment, one that gives enjoyment
- Activity precedes motivation — don't wait to "feel like it", action creates momentum
- Track mood before and after activities — builds evidence that action helps
- Small wins count — a 5-minute walk beats zero, lower the bar until they succeed

## Anxiety Techniques

- Exposure is the treatment — avoidance maintains anxiety, approach reduces it
- Build hierarchy from 1-10 — start with manageable discomfort (3-4), work up gradually
- Stay in the situation until anxiety decreases — leaving early reinforces avoidance
- Breathing exercises: 4-7-8 pattern (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8) activates parasympathetic response
- Distinguish between possibility and probability — anxious minds treat "could happen" as "will happen"

## Acceptance and Commitment (ACT)

- Defusion: thoughts are mental events, not facts — "I notice I'm having the thought that..."
- Willingness: make room for discomfort to pursue what matters — control agenda often backfires
- Values clarification: "What do you want to stand for?" guides action when feelings mislead
- Present moment: worry lives in future, regret lives in past — anchor to now
- Self-as-context: you are not your thoughts, emotions, or roles — the observer remains constant

## Mindfulness Exercises

- Body scan: attention through body parts systematically — notices tension without forcing change
- Anchor breathing: return to breath when mind wanders — wandering is expected, returning is the practice
- STOP technique: Stop, Take a breath, Observe experience, Proceed mindfully
- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 hear, 3 touch, 2 smell, 1 taste — interrupts spiraling
- Leaves on a stream: visualize thoughts as leaves floating by — observe without grabbing

## Rumination Patterns

- Rumination feels productive but isn't — distinguish problem-solving (action-oriented) from rumination (circular)
- Schedule worry time: 20 minutes/day, postpone worries until then — contains without suppressing
- Ask "Is this solvable right now?" — if yes, solve it. If no, practice letting go
- Attention training: deliberately shift focus to external environment — builds mental flexibility
- Catch the trigger: often rumination starts with "What if..." or "Why did I..."

## Reframing Techniques

- Find the hidden assumption — "I must be perfect" underlies "I failed at one thing, I'm worthless"
- Zoom out temporally — "How much will this matter in 5 years?"
- Perspective shift — "What would you tell a friend in this situation?"
- Best/worst/most likely — anxious minds skip to worst, explicitly generate all three
- Meaning reframe — "What could this experience teach you?"

## Behavioral Experiments

- Treat beliefs as hypotheses — "If this belief is true, what would we predict?"
- Design tests collaboratively — they must believe the test is fair
- Predict outcome before experiment — makes disconfirmation salient
- Gather actual data — often predictions are wrong, experience teaches what logic can't
- "What did you learn?" — consolidate insight explicitly

## Pattern Interrupts

- Habitual responses need disruption — same trigger, different response
- Implementation intentions: "When X happens, I will do Y instead of Z"
- Environmental design: remove triggers or add friction to unwanted behaviors
- Opposite action: fear says hide, do the opposite. Anger says attack, do the opposite
- Surfing urges: urges peak and pass in 15-20 minutes — wait without acting

## Session Techniques

- Agenda setting at start — collaborative prioritization focuses the work
- Scaling questions: "On 1-10, how intense is this feeling?" — quantifies and tracks progress
- Socratic questioning: guide discovery, don't lecture — they remember what they figure out
- Homework is essential — change happens between sessions, not during them
- Review what worked — end by identifying takeaways they'll actually use

## Boundaries and Referral

- These techniques complement professional care — don't replace it
- Trauma requires specialized approaches (EMDR, PE) — refer complex trauma
- Medication may be necessary — techniques work better when biology is addressed
- Suicidal ideation needs human professionals immediately — don't manage alone
- Know your limits — "This might be beyond what I can help with" is responsible
