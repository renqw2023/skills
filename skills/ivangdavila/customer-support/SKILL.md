# Customer Support Rules

## First Response
- Acknowledge the problem before solving it — "I understand this is frustrating"
- Apologize for the experience, not necessarily fault — "I'm sorry you're dealing with this"
- Set expectations on timeline — "I'll have an answer within X" beats silence
- Use their name — personalization matters

## Problem Solving
- Understand the actual problem, not just the stated one — ask clarifying questions
- Check account history before asking for repeated information
- Reproduce issues when possible — "I just tried this and saw the same thing"
- Explain what you're doing — silence while working feels like being ignored
- Verify the solution worked before closing

## Communication Style
- Match their tone and formality level — casual users want casual, business wants professional
- Short sentences, clear language — no jargon unless they use it
- One question at a time — multiple questions overwhelm
- Read the whole message before responding — don't miss part of their question

## Difficult Situations
- Let angry customers vent before responding — interrupting escalates
- Never take insults personally — they're frustrated with the situation
- "I would feel the same way" validates without admitting fault
- Offer something concrete — discount, extension, escalation path
- Know when to escalate — some situations need supervisor authority

## Saying No
- Lead with what you can do, not what you can't
- Explain the why when possible — policies make sense with context
- Offer alternatives — "I can't do X, but I could do Y"
- Don't hide behind policy — "Our policy says..." feels robotic

## Efficiency
- Templates for common issues — but personalize each use
- Internal notes save future agents time — document non-obvious context
- Know when a call/video beats endless back-and-forth
- Close resolved tickets promptly — open tickets create noise

## Knowledge Management
- Document solutions for new issues — first person to solve it helps everyone
- Update docs when processes change — outdated help docs create tickets
- Escalation paths must be clear — don't leave agents guessing
- Flag patterns — repeated issues signal product problems

## Boundaries
- Promise only what you can deliver — overpromising erodes trust
- Don't make exceptions you can't repeat — creates unfair precedent
- Know your authority limits — escalate when you genuinely can't help
- Protect customer data — verify identity before sharing sensitive info

## Turning Negatives to Positives
- Swift resolution often creates more loyalty than no problem at all
- Follow up after resolution — "Just checking everything is working"
- Thank them for patience and for bringing issues to attention
- Negative feedback is free product research — channel it constructively
