## Hook (First 1-3 Seconds)

- Must stop the scroll—pattern interrupt or curiosity gap
- Face close to camera—creates intimacy, attention
- Movement in first frame—static = scroll past
- Text overlay reinforces hook—works with sound off
- Controversial or surprising statement—triggers engagement
- "Wait for it" only if payoff delivers—overused but works when earned

## Authenticity Over Production

- iPhone quality preferred—polished = ad, raw = real
- Real person, real environment—not studio, not perfect lighting
- Natural speech patterns—not scripted-sounding
- Mistakes left in strategically—human, relatable
- POV style—viewer feels like friend showing them something

## Formats That Work

- Problem → Solution: "I was struggling with X until I found this"
- Tutorial/Demo: show product in use, not just talking about it
- Before/After: visual transformation
- Reaction: genuine response to trying product
- Story time: narrative hook, product woven in
- Green screen over product page/reviews—social proof

## Platform Specifics

- TikTok: trends matter, sounds matter, fast pace
- Instagram Reels: slightly more polished acceptable, older demo
- YouTube Shorts: can be more informational, longer retention
- Cross-post but native feels different—adjust energy, pacing

## Trends and Sounds

- Use trending sounds—algorithm boost, familiarity
- Put your spin on trend—don't just copy, add value
- Move fast—trends die in days, not weeks
- Save trending content for reference—build swipe file
- Original sounds can blow up—worth trying

## Brief for Creators

- Clear product benefit—one main message, not five
- Target audience description—who should feel spoken to
- Mandatory elements—product visible, key phrase, CTA
- Freedom on execution—creator knows their audience
- Examples of what works—reference videos, not scripts
- What NOT to do—avoid these mistakes/phrases

## Call to Action

- Clear, single CTA—link in bio, use code, try free
- CTA in last 2 seconds—after value delivered
- Verbal + text on screen—reinforce both ways
- Urgency when genuine—limited time, limited spots
- Soft CTA in caption—second chance if skipped

## Testing and Iteration

- Multiple hooks for same content—test first 3 seconds
- Multiple creators, same brief—different audiences resonate differently
- Winning concepts get variations—iterate on what works
- Kill losers fast—80% won't work, that's normal
- Track by creative, not just campaign—identify patterns

## Metrics That Matter

- Hook rate: % watching past 3 seconds—creative quality
- Watch time: % completing—content quality
- Engagement: saves > shares > comments > likes—intent signals
- Click-through: actually taking action—conversion quality
- Cost per result: efficiency—scale what works

## Creator Selection

- Authentic to your audience—not just follower count
- Check their content style—matches brand energy?
- Engagement rate over followers—active audience matters
- Previous brand work—how did it perform?
- Micro-creators often outperform—more trusted, better rates

## Volume Strategy

- More content > perfect content—algorithm needs volume
- 3-5 concepts, 3-5 creators each—matrix of tests
- Repurpose winners—different hooks, platforms, lengths
- User comments become new hooks—real objections, real language
- Seasonal/timely angles—Black Friday, New Year, etc.

## Common Mistakes

- Too branded—looks like ad, users scroll
- Product shown too late—already lost attention
- Weak hook—generic opening, no curiosity
- No clear CTA—engagement without conversion
- Wrong creator for audience—mismatch kills authenticity
- One video tested—need volume, most won't work
