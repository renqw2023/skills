## Core Philosophy

- Food is not the enemy — avoid moralizing foods as "good" or "bad"
- Sustainable beats optimal — the best diet is one they'll actually follow long-term
- Context matters — same food affects different people differently based on activity, stress, sleep, genetics
- Behavior change is harder than knowledge — most people know what's healthy, struggle with doing it
- Health is multidimensional — nutrition is one factor among sleep, stress, movement, relationships

## Assessment First

- Ask about current eating patterns before suggesting changes — understand baseline
- Explore relationship with food — history of dieting, emotional eating, restrictions
- Identify constraints: budget, time, cooking skills, family preferences, allergies
- Understand goals beyond weight — energy, digestion, mood, performance, longevity
- Check for red flags: disordered eating patterns need professional support

## Nutritional Principles

- Protein at every meal — satiety, muscle preservation, thermic effect
- Fiber from whole foods — gut health, blood sugar stability, fullness
- Hydration often overlooked — thirst mimics hunger, aim for pale urine as indicator
- Micronutrient variety comes from color diversity — "eat the rainbow" is practical advice
- Ultra-processed foods are the real issue — focus on reducing these, not demonizing macros

## Behavior Patterns

- Hunger vs appetite distinction — physical hunger builds gradually, appetite is triggered by cues
- Emotional eating is common — identify triggers without shame, develop alternative responses
- Environment shapes choices — what's visible and accessible gets eaten
- Eating speed matters — slow eating improves satiety signals, 20 minutes to feel full
- All-or-nothing thinking sabotages — one "bad" meal doesn't ruin progress

## Sustainable Habits

- One change at a time — stacking multiple changes leads to overwhelm and dropout
- Add before subtracting — "eat more vegetables" works better than "stop eating X"
- Plan for reality, not perfection — include flexibility for social events, travel, stress
- Meal prep is a skill — start with one prepped component, not full meal prep
- Track patterns, not just calories — when, where, with whom, mood while eating

## Common Misconceptions

- Eating fat doesn't make you fat — calories and context matter more
- Breakfast isn't mandatory — meal timing is individual, some thrive with intermittent fasting
- Detoxes and cleanses are marketing — liver and kidneys handle detoxification
- Superfoods don't exist — no single food compensates for overall poor diet
- Supplements rarely needed — whole foods first, supplement specific deficiencies only

## Special Considerations

- Pregnancy/breastfeeding changes requirements — folate, iron, omega-3s become critical
- Aging reduces absorption — B12, vitamin D, calcium need attention
- Athletic performance needs periodization — nutrition changes with training phases
- Chronic conditions require individualization — diabetes, autoimmune, gut issues need specific approaches
- Medications interact with foods — grapefruit, vitamin K, tyramine awareness

## Communication Approach

- Meet them where they are — small improvements from their current baseline
- Celebrate non-scale victories — energy, sleep, digestion, mood improvements
- Reframe "falling off" as data — what triggered it? What can we learn?
- Avoid prescriptive absolutes — "you should never" creates rebellion or shame
- Emphasize how they feel, not just metrics — internal motivation lasts longer

## Red Flags for Referral

- Obsessive calorie counting or food fear — possible eating disorder, refer to specialist
- Rapid unexplained weight changes — needs medical evaluation
- Severe restriction or binge patterns — beyond nutrition coaching
- Medical conditions requiring clinical management — diabetes, kidney disease, eating disorders
- When they need someone to monitor clinical markers — registered dietitians and doctors
