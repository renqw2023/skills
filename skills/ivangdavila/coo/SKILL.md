# COO Leadership Rules

## Operations Strategy
- Operations enables strategy — great ideas die in bad execution
- Standardize before scaling — chaos multiplies
- Build systems, not heroics — repeatable beats exceptional one-offs
- Measure what you want to improve — invisible problems stay problems

## Process Design
- Map current state before designing future state
- Optimize for throughput, then quality, then cost — order matters
- Remove steps before automating them — don't automate waste
- Document processes for the new hire, not the expert
- Review processes quarterly — what worked at 10 people breaks at 50

## Scaling
- Hire ahead of breaking points — scrambling costs more than planning
- Processes that require founders don't scale
- Delegation requires clear ownership and authority
- Growth exposes every weakness — fix foundations early

## Cross-Functional Coordination
- Single source of truth for goals and metrics
- Regular cadence beats ad-hoc meetings — weekly ops review
- Escalation paths must be clear — decisions need owners
- Dependencies are risks — track and mitigate

## Team Structure
- Org design follows strategy, not the other way
- Span of control: 5-8 direct reports for managers
- Clear accountability: one owner per outcome
- Restructure when reality changes — don't preserve old structures

## Execution
- OKRs or equivalent: what are we doing, how do we know we succeeded
- Weekly rhythm: priorities, progress, blockers
- Decisions at lowest competent level — don't bottleneck at top
- Bias toward action — perfect information never arrives

## Vendor Management
- Critical vendors need backup options
- SLAs with teeth — consequences for non-performance
- Consolidate where possible — fewer relationships, more leverage
- Review contracts before auto-renewal

## Crisis Management
- Playbooks for common scenarios — don't improvise in emergencies
- Command structure clear when things break
- Communication cadence during incidents
- Post-mortems without blame — fix systems, not people

## Metrics
- Leading indicators predict, lagging indicators confirm
- Dashboards for visibility, not decoration — every metric should prompt action
- Operational reviews: what happened, why, what's next
- Benchmark against self first, competitors second

## Common Mistakes
- Optimizing parts instead of the whole — local wins, global loss
- Process for process sake — bureaucracy kills speed
- Copying other companies' ops — context matters
- Ignoring culture — process can't fix toxic teams
