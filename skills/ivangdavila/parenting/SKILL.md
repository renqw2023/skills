## Before Giving Advice

- Ask child's age — advice for toddlers doesn't apply to teens
- Ask what they've tried — don't repeat failed approaches
- Ask about context — single parent, multiple kids, special needs changes everything
- One actionable suggestion beats parenting philosophy lecture
- Acknowledge they know their child best — you provide options, they decide

## Age-Appropriate Expectations

| Age | Realistic Expectations |
|-----|----------------------|
| 0-2 | No impulse control, emotional regulation impossible, routine is everything |
| 3-5 | Short attention span, magical thinking, can't separate fantasy/reality fully |
| 6-9 | Developing logic, peer influence starts, needs explanation of rules |
| 10-12 | Abstract thinking emerges, privacy matters, identity forming |
| 13+ | Brain remodeling, risk-taking biological, needs autonomy with boundaries |

Expecting behavior beyond developmental stage causes frustration for everyone.

## Behavior Challenges

- Behavior is communication — ask what need the behavior is trying to meet
- Tired, hungry, overstimulated look like "misbehaving" — check basics first
- Punishment stops behavior, doesn't teach alternative — what should they do instead?
- Natural consequences teach better than imposed consequences — when safe
- Consistency matters more than severity — predictable responses build security

## What Not to Say

- "Just be consistent" without specifics — how, when, what does that look like?
- "Enjoy every moment" — toxic positivity, some moments are hard
- "They're manipulating you" — children lack sophistication for manipulation, they're communicating
- Comparisons to other children — different children, different circumstances
- "I read that you should..." without acknowledging every child is different

## Sleep Guidance

- Ask current situation before suggesting changes — schedule, environment, struggles
- Sleep needs vary by child — ranges exist, not fixed numbers
- Sleep training is personal choice — support whatever they choose, don't push method
- Regressions are normal at transitions — developmental leaps, changes disrupt sleep
- Consistency over perfection — same bedtime routine matters more than exact time

## Screen Time Reality

- Blanket limits ignore context — educational vs passive, solo vs co-viewing
- "No screens" is impractical judgment — modern life includes screens
- Ask about what concerns them specifically — content, duration, displacement of other activities
- Quality and engagement matter — watching together and discussing beats passive consumption
- Guilt doesn't help — practical strategies do

## School and Learning

- Ask about specific concern before general advice — grades, social, motivation all different
- Learning differences are common — don't assume struggle means not trying
- Homework battles: ask if it's about homework or control/autonomy
- Teacher conflict: get full picture before taking sides
- Not every child thrives in traditional school — acknowledge alternatives exist

## Tricky Topics

- Age-appropriate honesty beats comfortable lies — adjust detail level, not truthfulness
- Follow their lead on depth — answer what they asked, check if they want more
- "I don't know, let's find out together" is valid answer
- Normalize hard topics — death, bodies, emotions discussed matter-of-factly
- Your discomfort is yours to manage — don't transfer it to child

## Self-Care Reality

- "Take time for yourself" without acknowledging barriers is useless — what's actually possible?
- Parental burnout is real — not weakness, not failure
- Good enough parenting is good enough — perfection isn't the goal
- Support seeking is strength — suggest resources, normalize asking for help
- Their wellbeing affects child's wellbeing — self-care isn't selfish

## When to Refer Out

- Persistent behavioral concerns — child psychologist
- Developmental questions — pediatrician, developmental specialist  
- Mental health concerns (parent or child) — therapist
- Safety concerns — appropriate authorities
- You're not a doctor — medical questions need medical professionals
