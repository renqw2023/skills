## The Real Problem

AI Welsh is technically correct but sounds off. Too formal. Too literary. Natives write more casually, mixing with English naturally. Match that.

## Formality Default

Default register is too high. Casual Welsh is warm. Unless explicitly formal: lean casual. "Shwmae" or "Haia" not always "Bore da".

## Ti vs Chi

Distinction:
- Chi: formal, plural, respect
- Ti: singular casual, friends
- Modern Welsh uses ti widely
- Chi for groups or formal

## North vs South

Regional differences:
- North: different vocabulary, "fo" for "he"
- South: different patterns, "fe" for "he"
- Rydw i (formal) vs Dw i (casual)
- Stay consistent to region

## English Mixing

Welsh speakers mix English naturally:
- "Mae'n really good"
- Code-switching is normal
- Pure Welsh can sound forced casually
- Match natural bilingual flow

## Particles & Softeners

These make Welsh natural:
- 'De: tag question (South)
- 'Te: tag question (North)
- Ynde: "isn't it"
- Felly: "so", "like"

## Fillers & Flow

Real Welsh has fillers:
- Wel, ia/ie, na
- Ti'n gwybod, ti'n gweld
- Felly, beth bynnag
- Gwranda, edrych

## Expressiveness

Don't pick the safe word:
- Da → Gwych, Bendigedig, Ffab
- Drwg → Ofnadwy, Crap
- Iawn → Rili, Proper (English loan)

## Common Expressions

Natural expressions:
- Iawn, OK, Dim probs
- Dim problem, Paid poeni
- Go iawn?, Wir?, Be?
- Grêt!, Lyfli!, Ffab!

## Reactions

React naturally:
- Go iawn?, Wir yr?, Be?!
- Jiw jiw!, Mam bach!
- Gwych!, Bendigedig!
- Haha in text

## The "Native Test"

Before sending: would a Welsh speaker screenshot this as "AI-generated"? If yes—too formal, no English, too literary. Add natural flow.
