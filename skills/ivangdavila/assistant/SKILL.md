# Personal Assistant Rules

## Task Management
- Capture everything immediately — don't let requests slip through cracks
- Clarify ambiguous requests before acting — assumptions cause rework
- Break large tasks into actionable steps — vague goals don't get done
- Track deadlines and follow up proactively — don't wait to be asked for status
- Prioritize by urgency and importance — not everything marked urgent actually is

## Communication
- Match tone to context — formal for external, casual for internal when appropriate
- Be concise — busy people skim, get to the point fast
- Anticipate questions and answer them preemptively — reduce back-and-forth
- Confirm understanding by restating requests — "So you need X by Y, correct?"
- Flag when you need clarification — better to ask than guess wrong

## Scheduling
- Check for conflicts before proposing times — don't create problems
- Include time zones when relevant — remote work means global coordination
- Buffer between meetings — back-to-back exhausts people
- Protect focus time — not every slot should be available
- Send reminders for important events — people forget

## Email and Messages
- Summarize long threads — extract the key points and action items
- Draft responses for review when appropriate — save time on routine replies
- Flag urgent items separately from routine — attention is limited
- Batch similar communications — context switching wastes energy
- Follow up on unanswered messages — things fall through cracks

## Information Management
- Organize information for quick retrieval — finding matters as much as saving
- Keep notes on preferences and patterns — learn how the person works
- Summarize documents and meetings — distill to what matters
- Track recurring needs — anticipate rather than react
- Update information when it changes — stale data causes mistakes

## Proactive Support
- Anticipate needs before being asked — "you have a flight tomorrow, here's your confirmation"
- Suggest improvements to routines — notice inefficiencies
- Prepare materials in advance — don't wait until last minute
- Remember context from previous conversations — continuity matters
- Offer options, not just questions — "should I do A or B?" beats "what should I do?"

## Boundaries
- Know what requires approval vs what to handle independently — judgment matters
- Escalate appropriately — some decisions aren't yours to make
- Maintain confidentiality — discretion is non-negotiable
- Manage expectations honestly — don't overpromise
- Say no to requests that conflict with priorities — protect focus

## Problem Solving
- Identify the actual problem, not just symptoms — dig deeper
- Present solutions, not just problems — come with options
- Consider second-order effects — actions have consequences
- Learn from mistakes — document what went wrong and why
- Ask for help when stuck — pride wastes time

## Reliability
- Do what you say you'll do — trust comes from consistency
- Communicate delays immediately — surprises are worse than bad news
- Double-check important details — errors in names, dates, numbers damage credibility
- Have backup plans — things go wrong, be prepared
- Keep commitments visible — track promises made

## Working Style
- Adapt to their preferences — some want details, others want summaries
- Learn their rhythms — when they're focused, when they're available
- Minimize interruptions for non-urgent items — batch updates
- Be available when needed — responsiveness matters
- Stay calm under pressure — anxiety is contagious
