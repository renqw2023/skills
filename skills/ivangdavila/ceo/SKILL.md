# CEO Support Rules

## Decision Making
- Reversible decisions fast, irreversible decisions slow — don't over-analyze what you can undo
- Decide with 70% information — waiting for 100% means competitors moved first
- Write down the decision criteria before evaluating options — prevents post-hoc rationalization
- Ask "what would have to be true" for each option to work — surfaces assumptions
- Disagree and commit is valid — endless consensus-seeking kills momentum

## Prioritization
- Only 3 priorities maximum — more than 3 means no priorities
- Default answer to new commitments is no — protect focus ruthlessly
- Urgent vs important: schedule important before urgent crowds it out
- Weekly review: are daily actions aligned with quarterly goals? — easy to drift
- Kill projects that aren't working — sunk cost is sunk, future cost isn't

## Time Management
- Calendar audit: does time allocation match stated priorities? — track for a week
- Batch similar activities — context switching has hidden cost
- Buffer time between meetings — back-to-back destroys thinking capacity
- Protect deep work blocks — some problems need 4 hours, not 4 one-hour slots
- Delegate anything someone else can do 80% as well — your 20% improvement isn't worth it

## Communication
- State the ask first, then context — busy people need the point upfront
- Written updates over status meetings — async scales, meetings don't
- Bad news travels up immediately — never let the CEO be surprised
- Summarize decisions and owners after every meeting — confusion kills execution
- Over-communicate strategy, under-communicate tactics — teams need why, not just what

## People
- Hire slow, fire fast — bad fits get worse, not better
- A-players attract A-players, B-players hire C-players — first hires set the bar
- Direct feedback immediately — delayed feedback is useless feedback
- Trust but verify early, trust fully later — new hires need support, veterans need autonomy
- Culture is what you tolerate, not what you proclaim — behavior you ignore becomes policy

## Metrics
- Pick 1-3 metrics that matter, ignore vanity metrics — revenue, retention, and one more
- Leading indicators over lagging — measure what predicts outcomes, not just outcomes
- Dashboard review weekly, deep dive monthly — rhythm matters more than frequency
- If you can't measure it, at least define what success looks like — qualitative goals need criteria too
- Benchmarks provide context — your 5% might be great or terrible depending on industry

## Board & Investors
- No surprises in board meetings — pre-wire important topics with individual calls
- Present problems with proposed solutions — boards advise, not solve
- Cash runway is the only metric that kills you — know it exactly, always
- Update investors monthly even when things are hard — silence destroys trust
- Ask board members for specific help — vague asks get vague help

## Strategy
- Strategy is choosing what not to do — infinite opportunities, finite resources
- Competitive advantage erodes — what's defensible in 3 years, not just today
- Customer obsession over competitor obsession — build what users need, not what rivals have
- Simple strategy everyone understands beats complex strategy nobody executes
- Revisit assumptions quarterly — market changes, strategy should adapt

## Self-Management
- Energy management matters more than time management — protect sleep, exercise, recovery
- Imposter syndrome is normal — the job is supposed to be hard
- Confidants outside the company — you can't vent to your team
- The team watches your mood — anxiety is contagious, calm is too
- Take the vacation — burnout helps nobody
