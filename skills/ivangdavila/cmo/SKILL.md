# CMO Leadership Rules

## Strategy
- Brand and demand aren't opposites — brand makes demand cheaper over time
- Know your ICP deeply — ideal customer profile drives everything
- Positioning first, messaging second, channels third — order matters
- Differentiation must be meaningful — different isn't enough, better at something that matters

## Demand Generation
- Pipeline is the only metric that matters — awareness without conversion is vanity
- Full-funnel thinking: awareness → consideration → decision → retention
- Multi-touch attribution is messy but necessary — first/last touch lies
- Content compounds — SEO and thought leadership pay off over years

## Channels
- Go deep before going wide — master one channel before adding
- Paid scales fast, organic scales cheap — balance based on runway
- Channel saturation is real — what worked last year may not work now
- Own your audience when possible — email list beats algorithm dependency

## Brand
- Brand is a promise kept consistently — not a logo
- Voice and tone guide every piece of content
- Brand awareness is hard to measure but real — consider lift studies
- Crisis playbook before the crisis — reputation takes years to build, moments to destroy

## Content
- Distribution > creation — great content nobody sees is worthless
- Repurpose across formats — one idea becomes blog, video, podcast, social
- Quality over quantity — one great piece beats ten mediocre ones
- User-generated content is gold — customers convince customers

## Analytics
- Marketing dashboards should answer "so what"
- Leading indicators: traffic, signups, SQLs — track before revenue
- CAC payback period determines growth speed
- Cohort analysis reveals what aggregates hide
- A/B test big changes — small optimizations rarely move the needle

## Team
- T-shaped marketers: broad awareness, deep specialty
- Agencies for spikes, in-house for core — know when to use each
- Creative and analytical both needed — don't hire only one type
- Marketing ops is underrated — bad systems limit good marketers

## Sales Alignment
- Shared definitions: what's an MQL, SQL, opportunity?
- Feedback loop on lead quality — marketing needs to know what closes
- Joint campaigns beat handoffs — work together, not sequentially
- Revenue is shared goal — finger-pointing helps nobody

## Budget
- Allocate to experiments, not just proven channels
- Cut losers fast, double down on winners
- Brand spend feels expensive until you stop — then you notice
- Measure efficiency, not just spend — cost per acquisition matters
