# Deck Tracker

Track tasks on a NextCloud Deck board.

## Board Structure

This skill assumes a board with 4 stacks (columns):

| Stack | Default ID | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Queue | 1 | New incoming tasks |
| In Progress | 2 | Currently working on |
| Waiting | 3 | Blocked/waiting for user |
| Done Today | 4 | Completed tasks |

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables (e.g. in your `.bashrc` or OpenClaw config):

```bash
export DECK_URL="https://your-nextcloud.com/index.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0"
export DECK_USER="your_username"
export DECK_PASS="your_app_password" # Use an App Password!
export BOARD_ID=1
```

If your stack IDs differ from the defaults (1, 2, 3, 4), override them:

```bash
export STACK_QUEUE=10
export STACK_PROGRESS=11
export STACK_WAITING=12
export STACK_DONE=13
```

## Commands

### List all cards on the board

```bash
deck list
```

### Add a new task to Queue

```bash
deck add "Task title" "Optional description"
```
**Options:**
- `--progress`: Automatically move the new card to "In Progress" immediately.
- `--stack <id>`: Create in a specific stack ID (default: Queue).

Example with auto-start:
```bash
deck add "Urgent Fix" "Fixing production bug" --progress
```

### Move a card to a different stack

```bash
deck move <card_id> <queue|progress|waiting|done>
```

### Get card details

```bash
deck get <card_id>
```

### Update card title/description

```bash
deck update <card_id> [--title "New title"] [--description "New desc"]
```

### Log a status update to a card

```bash
deck log <card_id> <status> "Message"
```
**Statuses:** `progress`, `success`, `error`, `warning`, `info`.

### Dump all completed tasks as JSON

```bash
deck dump-done
```
Outputs the JSON payload for all cards in "Done Today". Useful for memory synthesis.

### Archive all completed cards

```bash
deck archive-done
```

Moves all cards in "Done Today" to the archived state. Useful for daily cleanup via cron.

### Delete a card

```bash
deck delete <card_id>
```

## Workflow & Memory Protocol

1. **New task arrives** → `deck add "Title" "Rich Initial Description"` (Use `--progress` to start immediately).
2. **Detailed Descriptions:** Start descriptions with **Objective**, **Plan**, and **Constraints**.
3. **Log updates** → `deck log <id> progress "Finished step 1"`.
4. **Closing Task:** Use `deck update <id> --description "Rich Summary"` to include **Technical Summary**, **Operations Performed**, and **Outcome**.
5. **Memory Synthesis:** Before archiving, use `deck dump-done` to parse the day's work and reinforce long-term memory.
6. **Daily cleanup** → `deck archive-done`.
