# SKILL.md - AI Act Risk Check

## `ai-act-risk-check`

**Description:** Quickly assesses a preliminary risk classification for an AI system based on the high-risk categories listed in Annex III of the EU AI Act (focusing on biometrics, critical infrastructure, education, employment, essential services, law enforcement, and justice).

**Usage:**
\`\`\`bash
ai-act-risk-check "Our system is an AI algorithm that screens job applications based on predicted performance metrics."
\`\`\`

**Output:** A determination of HIGH-RISK or LOW-RISK, along with the relevant Annex III category (if high-risk).

**Dependencies:** None (uses pure shell and `oracle` via `exec` for inference).

**Execution Logic:** Passes the user's description to an LLM for classification against the hard-coded Annex III criteria.
