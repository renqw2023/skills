# Skillvet

Security scanner for agent skills. 48 critical checks, 8 warning checks. No dependencies — just bash and grep. Includes Tirith-inspired detection patterns, campaign signatures from [Koi Security](https://www.koi.ai/blog/clawhavoc-341-malicious-clawedbot-skills-found-by-the-bot-they-were-targeting), [Bitdefender](https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/technical-advisory-openclaw-exploitation-enterprise-networks), [Snyk](https://snyk.io/articles/clawdhub-malicious-campaign-ai-agent-skills/), and [1Password](https://1password.com/blog/from-magic-to-malware-how-openclaws-agent-skills-become-an-attack-surface) ClickFix patterns.

## Usage

**Safe install** (installs, audits, auto-removes if critical):

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/safe-install.sh <skill-slug>
```

**Audit an existing skill:**

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/skill-audit.sh skills/some-skill
```

**Audit all installed skills:**

```bash
for d in skills/*/; do bash skills/skillvet/scripts/skill-audit.sh "$d"; done
```

**JSON output** (for automation):

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/skill-audit.sh --json skills/some-skill
```

**SARIF output** (for GitHub Code Scanning / VS Code):

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/skill-audit.sh --sarif skills/some-skill
```

**Summary mode** (one-line per skill):

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/skill-audit.sh --summary skills/some-skill
```

**Verbose mode** (debug which checks run and what files are scanned):

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/skill-audit.sh --verbose skills/some-skill
```

**Scan remote skill without installing:**

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/scan-remote.sh <skill-slug>
```

**Diff scan** (only scan what changed between versions):

```bash
bash skills/skillvet/scripts/diff-scan.sh path/to/old-version path/to/new-version
```

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` warnings only, `2` critical findings.

### Advanced Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | JSON output for CI/dashboards |
| `--sarif` | SARIF v2.1.0 output for GitHub Code Scanning |
| `--summary` | One-line output per skill |
| `--verbose` | Show which checks run and which files are scanned |
| `--exclude-self` | Skip scan when scanning own source directory |
| `--max-file-size N` | Skip files larger than N bytes |
| `--max-depth N` | Limit directory traversal depth |

### Suppressing False Positives

Create a `.skillvetrc` file in the skill directory to disable specific checks:

```
# Disable check #4 (obfuscation) and #20 (shortened URLs)
disable:4
disable:20
```

Or add inline comments to suppress individual lines:

```js
const url = "https://bit.ly/legit-link"; // skillvet-ignore
```

### Pre-commit Hook

Install the git pre-commit hook to auto-scan skills before committing:

```bash
ln -sf ../../scripts/pre-commit-hook .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Risk Scoring

Each finding has a severity weight (1-10). The aggregate risk score is included in JSON, SARIF, and summary output. Higher scores indicate more dangerous patterns:

- **10**: Reverse shells, known C2 IPs
- **9**: Data exfiltration, pipe-to-shell, persistence + network, ClickFix, base64 execution
- **7-8**: Credential theft, obfuscation, path traversal, time bombs
- **4-6**: Punycode, homographs, ANSI injection, shortened URLs
- **2-3**: Subprocess execution, network requests, file writes

## Warning Checks (flagged for review)

| # | Check | Example |
|---|-------|---------|
| W1 | Unknown external tool requirements | Non-standard CLI tools in install instructions |
| W2 | Subprocess execution | child_process, execSync, spawn, subprocess |
| W3 | Network requests | axios, fetch, requests imports |
| W4 | Minified/bundled files | First line >500 chars — can't audit |
| W5 | Filesystem write operations | writeFile, open('w'), fs.append |
| W6 | Insecure transport | `curl -k`, `verify=False` — TLS disabled |
| W7 | Docker untrusted registries | Non-standard image sources |

## Scanned File Types

`.md`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.py`, `.sh`, `.bash`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.rb`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml`, `.txt`, `.env*`, `Dockerfile*`, `Makefile`, `pom.xml`, `.gradle`.

Binary files are automatically skipped. Symlinks are followed.

## Portability

Works on Linux and macOS. Unicode checks (#12, #16, #17) use `grep -P` where available, falling back to `perl` on systems without Perl-compatible regex (e.g., stock macOS). If neither is available, those checks are silently skipped.

## IOC Updates

The C2 IP blocklist in check #25 is based on known indicators from:
- [Koi Security report](https://www.koi.ai/blog/clawhavoc-341-malicious-clawedbot-skills-found-by-the-bot-they-were-targeting) (Feb 2026)
- [The Hacker News coverage](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/researchers-find-341-malicious-clawhub.html)
- [OpenSourceMalware analysis](https://opensourcemalware.com/blog/clawdbot-skills-ganked-your-crypto)

To update IOCs, edit the `KNOWN_IPS` entry in `scripts/patterns.b64` (base64-encoded regex pattern).

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

A `.github/workflows/test.yml` is included — runs the test suite on both Ubuntu and macOS on push/PR.

### GitHub Code Scanning (SARIF)

```yaml
- name: Run skillvet
  run: bash scripts/skill-audit.sh --sarif skills/some-skill > results.sarif || true

- name: Upload SARIF
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: results.sarif
```

## Limitations

Static analysis only. English-centric prompt injection patterns. Minified JS is flagged but not deobfuscated. A clean scan raises the bar but doesn't guarantee safety.

The scanner flags itself when audited — its own patterns contain the strings it detects. Use `--exclude-self` to skip self-scanning in CI.
