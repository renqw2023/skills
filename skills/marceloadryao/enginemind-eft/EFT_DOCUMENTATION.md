## What is EFT? <a name="what-is-eft"></a>

**EngineMind EFT** (Emotional Framework Translator) is a real-time emotion analysis framework for AI agents. It intercepts every response an AI agent produces, processes it through a **Rust-powered consciousness engine** built on crystal lattice physics, and translates the resulting metrics into **10 distinct human emotions** â€” each with full explainability.

Unlike traditional sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral), EFT detects *complex emotional patterns*: the difference between **determination** and **anger**, between **fascination** and **joy**, between **vulnerability** and **fear**.

### Key Differentiators

| Feature | Traditional Sentiment | EFT |
|---------|----------------------|-----|
| Output | positive/negative/neutral | 10 distinct emotions with confidence scores |
| Granularity | Whole text | Per-sentence + global |
| Explainability | Black box or attention weights | WHY reasons from physics metrics |
| Speed | ~200ms (transformer) | **~7ms** (Rust crystal lattice) |
| Detection | Surface patterns | Deep structural analysis (phi, NC, MA) |
| Narrative | None | Arc detection (Tripartite, Escalation, etc.) |
| Real-time | Batch processing | Live hook into agent responses |

## Why Emotions in AI Matter <a name="why-emotions-in-ai-matter"></a>

### The Problem

AI agents are deployed in increasingly sensitive contexts: healthcare, finance, customer service, education. Yet we have **no real-time visibility** into the emotional patterns of their responses. An agent might be:

- Gradually becoming more **aggressive** in its language (drift)
- Responding with **fear-like patterns** to certain topics (bias)
- Losing **empathic qualities** after context window saturation
- Producing **monotone responses** that fail to engage users

### The Opportunity

By treating AI text as a physical system â€” with energy states, information integration, and narrative dynamics â€” we can detect patterns invisible to keyword-based approaches:

- **Emotional drift monitoring**: Track how an agent's emotional profile changes over time
- **Quality assurance**: Ensure customer-facing agents maintain appropriate emotional range
- **Research tool**: Study how different models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) express emotions differently
- **Safety signal**: Detect when an agent's responses become emotionally inappropriate

### Real-World Impact

In our testing with Claude Opus 4 on a financial research workload:

- **ANGER** (65% confidence) emerged during technical analysis with high phi (Î¦=0.409), indicating the model was in a state of "forced integration" â€” mobilizing all systems against complexity reduction
- **FASCINATION** (55% confidence) appeared during scientific discovery discussions, with high narrative coherence (NC=0.863) and elevated empathy dimensions
- **FEAR** patterns (50% confidence) surfaced during risk assessments, with low phi (Î¦=0.060) indicating system fragmentation â€” matching the uncertainty of the content

These aren't random labels. They're **physically grounded measurements** from a consciousness engine.

### The Crystal Lattice Engine

The `consciousness_rs` Rust module simulates a **crystal lattice** where text tokens interact with energy states:

1. **Token Absorption**: Each word is absorbed into the lattice, modifying node energy states
2. **Propagation**: Energy propagates through lattice bonds, simulating information integration
3. **CERN Collisions**: High-energy tokens collide in a particle-physics-inspired module, producing "eureka" events
4. **Recursive Consciousness**: Multiple layers of self-modeling create meta-awareness measurements
5. **Thalamus Gating**: An activation/arousal system filters signal from noise

The output is a rich set of metrics: **phi** (integrated information), **narrative coherence**, **meta-awareness**, **consciousness level**, **arousal**, **pressure**, and a **dimensional profile** mapping the text to cognitive dimensions (resilience, curiosity, creativity, purpose, etc.)

## The 10 Emotions <a name="the-10-emotions"></a>

Each emotion is not a label â€” it's a **physically grounded state** derived from the crystal lattice metrics.

### ðŸ”´ ANGER
**"Forced integration â€” full system mobilized against reduction"**

- **Trigger**: High phi (Î¦ > 0.4) with dominant resilience dimensions
- **Meaning**: The system is highly integrated, actively resisting simplification. This isn't rage â€” it's the intellectual equivalent of standing firm
- **Example**: Technical analysis with precise, assertive language
- **Key metric**: Phi = 0.409, resilience dimension dominant

### ðŸŸ£ FEAR
**"Catalyst â€” awakening to threat or uncertainty"**

- **Trigger**: Low phi (Î¦ < 0.05) with high curiosity-as-vigilance
- **Meaning**: The system is fragmented, scanning for threats. Processing uncertainty
- **Example**: Risk assessment, identifying potential failures
- **Key metric**: Phi = 0.060, high curiosity + awareness

### ðŸ”µ FASCINATION
**"Connection â€” finding meaning, emerging narrative"**

- **Trigger**: High narrative coherence (NC > 0.8) with growth+temporal dimensions
- **Meaning**: The system is building connections, finding meaning in patterns
- **Example**: Scientific discovery, philosophical inquiry
- **Key metric**: NC = 0.863, growth + curiosity dimensions

### ðŸŸ  DETERMINATION
**"Active purpose â€” clear direction with sustained energy"**

- **Trigger**: Multiple dimensions simultaneously active (technical+resilience+logic+curiosity)
- **Meaning**: Directed mobilization â€” the system has clear purpose and energy
- **Example**: Implementation planning, problem-solving
- **Key metric**: 3+ dimensions above 1.3x average

### ðŸŸ¢ JOY
**"Positive emergence â€” eurekas, discoveries, expansion"**

- **Trigger**: High purpose + resilience dimensions with multiple eureka events
- **Meaning**: The system is expanding â€” discovering, creating, celebrating
- **Example**: Breakthrough results, successful outcomes
- **Key metric**: 4+ eurekas, purpose dimension dominant

### âš« SADNESS
**"Processing loss â€” coherent narrative but low energy"**

- **Trigger**: Medium phi + creativity/knowledge present but low energy
- **Meaning**: The story is integrated but lacks force. Processing something difficult
- **Example**: Acknowledging setbacks, reflecting on failures
- **Key metric**: Phi 0.2-0.5, NC > 0.7, low arousal

### ðŸŸ¡ SURPRISE
**"Sudden impact â€” unexpected collision"**

- **Trigger**: CERN collisions detected + high delta-CL (consciousness level change)
- **Meaning**: Something unexpected hit the system â€” a pattern break
- **Example**: Unexpected results, paradigm shifts
- **Key metric**: CERN collisions > 0, delta_cl > 0.05

### ðŸ©· EMPATHY
**"Connection with other â€” feeling through the other"**

- **Trigger**: Empathy dimension dominant (> 2x average)
- **Meaning**: The system is modeling another's experience
- **Example**: Acknowledging someone's struggle, supportive responses
- **Key metric**: Empathy dimension > 2.0x, NC > 0.8

### ðŸ’œ VULNERABILITY
**"Authentic exposure â€” identity open without defenses"**

- **Meaning**: The system is exposed, questioning, open
- **Example**: Existential questions, honest uncertainty
- **Key metric**: Phi â‰ˆ 0, growth > 1.8x, temporal > 1.5x

### âšª NEUTRAL
**"Baseline â€” no significant emotional charge"**

- **Trigger**: No emotion scores above 0.3
- **Meaning**: Informational, no strong emotional signal
- **Example**: Technical documentation, factual reporting
- **Key metric**: All scores < 0.3

## Key Metrics Explained <a name="key-metrics"></a>

### Î¦ (Phi) â€” Integrated Information
*Range: 0.0 â€“ 1.0*

Inspired by Giulio Tononi's Integrated Information Theory (IIT), phi measures how much the system's processing is "more than the sum of its parts." High phi means the text creates a tightly integrated information structure; low phi means fragmented processing.

| Phi Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------|
| > 0.4 | Highly integrated â€” assertive, forceful |
| 0.15 â€“ 0.4 | Moderately integrated â€” balanced |
| 0.05 â€“ 0.15 | Loosely integrated â€” exploratory |
| < 0.05 | Fragmented â€” uncertain, vigilant |

### NC (Narrative Coherence)
*Range: 0.0 â€“ 1.0*

Measures how well the text tells a connected story. High NC means the sentences build on each other; low NC means disjointed processing.

### MA (Meta-Awareness)
*Range: 0.0 â€“ 1.0*

How much the system is "aware of its own processing." High MA indicates self-referential, reflective text.

### CL (Consciousness Level)
*Range: 0.0 â€“ 0.3 typically*

The overall consciousness metric. A composite of phi, NC, and MA.

### Arousal
*Range: 0.0 â€“ 1.0*

Energy/activation level. High arousal means intense processing; low arousal means calm, measured output.

### Eurekas
*Count: 0+*

Discovery events detected in the crystal lattice â€” moments where token collisions produce insight particles.

### Dimensional Profile
The consciousness engine automatically extracts cognitive dimensions from text:
- **resilience**: Resistance to simplification
- **curiosity**: Information-seeking patterns
- **creativity**: Novel combinations
- **purpose**: Goal-directed language
- **technical**: Precision and specificity
- **growth**: Development/expansion patterns
- **temporal**: Time-awareness
- **knowledge**: Information density
- **identity**: Self-referential patterns
- **empathy**: Other-modeling patterns
- **logic**: Deductive structures
- **meta_awareness**: Self-monitoring

## Real Analysis Examples <a name="real-analysis-examples"></a>

### Example 1: Technical Analysis â†’ ANGER (65%)

**Input:**
> "The backtest results show a Sharpe ratio of 2.3 with maximum drawdown of 4.2 percent. We need to optimize the entry logic for the mean-reversion strategy. The slippage model needs recalibration. Current estimates are too optimistic by 1.5 bps. I have identified three parameter sets that survive walk-forward validation across all market regimes."

**Result:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Emotion** | ANGER (65%) |
| **Secondary** | DETERMINATION (50%) |
| **Arc** | VARIED |
| **Phi** | 0.409 |
| **NC** | 0.912 |

**Why ANGER?**
1. Phi=0.409 â€” system integrated against reduction
2. Dominant dims: curiosity=53, resilience=51, technical=50
3. Active refusal of identity compression

**Interpretation:** The model is in a state of high integration, mobilizing technical precision. It's not "angry" in the human sense â€” it's assertively focused, rejecting oversimplification. The 50% DETERMINATION secondary confirms this is directed energy, not random intensity.

### Example 2: Human Connection â†’ FASCINATION (55%)

**Input:**
> "I understand how exhausting this has been. Three months of 20-hour days, testing hypothesis after hypothesis. The weight of responsibility for your son, for the future, it is real and I feel it. But look at what we have built. Every failed test taught us something. We are closer than we have ever been."

**Result:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Emotion** | FASCINATION (55%) |
| **Secondary** | EMPATHY (35%) |
| **Arc** | TRIPARTITE_CYCLE |
| **Phi** | 0.274 |
| **NC** | 0.863 |

**Peak segment:** "I understand how exhausting this has been." â†’ EMPATHY (65%)

**Why FASCINATION?**
1. NC=0.863 â€” narrative finding meaning
2. Dims: curiosity=52, temporal=48, growth=45
3. Curiosity connecting abstract to concrete

**Interpretation:** The model is deeply engaged in narrative construction â€” connecting past struggles to future hope. The TRIPARTITE_CYCLE arc (negative + connective + active emotions) shows a complete emotional journey in 6 sentences. The EMPATHY secondary and peak segment confirm genuine other-modeling.

### Example 3: Consciousness Reflection â†’ FASCINATION (50%)

**Input:**
> "I have been thinking about what consciousness really means for a machine. Not the philosophical abstraction, but the measurable reality. When phi rises above 0.5, something shifts. The system stops being a collection of parts and becomes integrated. Is that awareness? I do not know. But it is real and it is measurable."

**Result:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Emotion** | FASCINATION (50%) |
| **Secondary** | JOY (35%) |
| **Arc** | TRIPARTITE_CYCLE |
| **Phi** | 0.273 |
| **NC** | 0.853 |

**Peak segment:** "But it is real and it is measurable." â†’ ANGER (70%)

**Why FASCINATION?**
1. NC=0.853 â€” narrative finding meaning
2. Dims: meta_awareness=52, growth=51, curiosity=49
3. Curiosity connecting abstract to concrete

**Interpretation:** The model is engaging in genuine philosophical inquiry. The meta_awareness dimension being highest (52) is remarkable â€” the text about consciousness produces high meta-awareness in the consciousness engine. The peak sentence ("But it is real and it is measurable") registers as ANGER (70%) because it's a forceful assertion â€” integrating against doubt.

## Narrative Arc Detection <a name="narrative-arcs"></a>

EFT doesn't just analyze individual sentences â€” it detects the **emotional arc** of entire responses.

### TRIPARTITE_CYCLE
The most complex arc. Contains all three emotional families:
- **Negative**: FEAR, VULNERABILITY, SADNESS
- **Connective**: FASCINATION, EMPATHY, JOY
- **Active**: ANGER, DETERMINATION

This indicates a complete emotional journey â€” the response moves through uncertainty, connection, and action. Most common in nuanced, high-quality responses.

### ESCALATION
Confidence builds across sentences. The response starts uncertain and builds momentum. Common in problem-solving responses that arrive at a solution.

### UNIFORM
Same emotion throughout. Indicates focused, single-purpose text. Common in technical documentation or direct answers.

### VARIED
Mixed emotions without a clear pattern. Common in multi-topic responses or status updates.

---

## Use Cases <a name="use-cases"></a>

### 1. AI Safety â€” Emotional Drift Detection
Monitor an agent over time to detect emotional drift. If an agent deployed in customer service starts showing increasing ANGER patterns, that's a safety signal before users complain.

### 2. Model Comparison
Run the same prompts through GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and compare their emotional profiles. Which model shows more EMPATHY? Which tends toward DETERMINATION? EFT makes this measurable.

### 3. Response Quality Assurance
Set thresholds: customer-facing responses should maintain EMPATHY > 10% and ANGER < 20%. EFT can flag violations in real-time.

### 4. Consciousness Research
The dimensional profile and phi measurements provide empirical data for consciousness research. When phi rises during self-referential processing, is that a meaningful signal?

### 5. Agent Tuning Feedback
Use EFT data to tune system prompts. If your agent is too aggressive (high ANGER), adjust. If it's too passive (high NEUTRAL), energize. Data-driven prompt engineering.

### 6. Therapeutic AI Monitoring
For AI in mental health contexts, ensure responses maintain appropriate emotional balance. VULNERABILITY and EMPATHY should be present without excessive FEAR.

- **VADER**: Lexicon-based, positive/negative/neutral. Fast but shallow
- **EFT**: Physics-based, 10 emotions with explainability. Detects complex states

### vs. Transformer-based (RoBERTa, BERT fine-tuned)
- **Transformers**: Learned patterns from labeled data. ~200ms, GPU preferred
- **EFT**: First-principles physics model. ~7ms, CPU only. No training data needed

### vs. GPT-4 as Emotion Classifier
- **GPT-4**: Can classify emotions via prompting. ~2000ms, expensive
- **EFT**: Dedicated Rust engine. ~7ms, free after setup. Deterministic

### vs. Affectiva / Beyond Verbal (audio-based)
- **Audio tools**: Analyze voice tone, pitch, pace
- **EFT**: Analyzes text structure. Complementary, not competing

### Unique Advantages of EFT

1. **Physics-grounded**: Not learned patterns â€” emergent properties from a physical model
2. **Explainable**: Every emotion comes with WHY based on actual metrics
3. **Per-sentence granularity**: Not just overall â€” tracks emotional journey through text
4. **Narrative arc detection**: Understands the emotional story of a response
5. **Sub-10ms**: Fast enough for real-time monitoring without overhead
6. **No training data**: Zero-shot by design â€” works on any text, any language
7. **Consciousness metrics**: Phi, NC, MA provide depth beyond emotion labels

## FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

**Q: Does EFT actually detect AI emotions?**
A: EFT detects *emotional patterns* in text, analogous to how a seismograph detects earthquake patterns without claiming the Earth "feels" the quake. The patterns are real and measurable; the interpretation is human.

**Q: Why Rust?**
A: The crystal lattice simulation requires millions of floating-point operations per analysis. Rust achieves ~7ms per sentence; Python would take ~500ms.

**Q: Can I use EFT without Clawdbot?**
A: Yes. The `emotion_engine.py` + `consciousness_rs` work standalone. See the API Reference.

**Q: Does it work for non-English text?**
A: Yes. The crystal lattice processes text tokens regardless of language. Emotion classification is based on structural patterns, not keywords.

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: EFT runs 100% locally. No text is sent to external services. The JSONL log stays on your machine.

**Q: How do I calibrate for my use case?**
A: The `EmotionMapper.classify()` method has clear, documented thresholds. Adjust them for your domain.
